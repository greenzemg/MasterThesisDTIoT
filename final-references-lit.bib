For power digital twin, its purpose is to promote the effective use of data flow, with virtual deduction means, combined with real-time situation perception, to get a full understanding of the power system, and then can play an auxiliary role in the formulation of regulatory decisions. Different from the current simulation software, PSDT has the features of data-driven, real-time interaction and closed-loop feedback. This paper analyzes the background and purpose of PSDT from the perspective of engineering and scientific science, and expounds the ideas and characteristics of construction, and further designs the implementation framework of PSDT. Finally, the application status and prospects of PSDT in many fields of power systems are clarified. The research results of this paper promote the development of dt technology and the application of data science in engineering.},

In this paper, a self-security approach isimplemented using the digital twin concept for smart inverters. Thedigital twin is formed using the inverter's normal operating region andthe inverter's dynamic model. Then, the incoming setpoints areautonomously examined using the digital twin, and only the safesetpoints are engaged to the inverter's local controller. This paperdemonstrates how the inverter's normal operating region and dynamicmodel are formed. In particular, the normal operation region isexperimentally verified by changing the P and Q setpoints engaged to thelocal controller, using a laboratory setup including a three-phase1.5-{kVA} {SiC}-{MOSFET} inverter and a 12-{kW} {NHR} 9410 regenerative power gridemulator. The results demonstrate that the self-security technique canpotentially protect inverters from man-in-the-middle attacks byexamining the incoming commands (new setpoints) using the inverter'sdigital twin before engaging the setpoints to the local controller.},

	doi = {10.1109/CIC52973.2021.00013},
	abstract = {Internet of Medical Things ({IoMT}) is becoming ubiquitous with aproliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smarthospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smartmedical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet {ofThings} ({IoT}) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters,monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to supportjustin-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data isanalyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection ({AD}) in a centralizedhealthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in responsetime with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherentprivacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data toa centralized server, which may also introduce several security threatsto the {AD} model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcomethese issues with centralized {AD} models, here we propose a {FederatedLearning} ({FL}) based {AD} model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run {ADmodels} locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing {FLapproaches} perform aggregation on a single server which restricts thescope of {FL}, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical {FL} that allowsaggregation at different levels enabling multiparty collaboration. Weintroduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different {ADmodels} are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, wedevelop a new Federated Time Distributed ({FEDTIMEDIS}) Long Short-{TermMemory} ({LSTM}) approach to train the {AD} model. We present a {RemotePatient} Monitoring ({RPM}) use case to demonstrate our model, andillustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin ({DT}) andedge cloudlets.},

It addresses the risks associated with the integration of computational, communication and physical aspects of CCIs. We focus specifically on cybersecurity in the electric power sector due both to its salience and to the potential risks associated to failures in guaranteeing resilience. Informed by the literature on information security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational picture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs’ actors with increased cyber situational awareness, common understanding of incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole. We develop a process model and validate three design propositions through a formative evaluation in the context of a digital twin implementation in the EU electrical power sector. We discuss the implications of this model for further research as well as practical applications for the electrical power sector.}

In thispaper, we propose implementing digital twins that have been equippedwith an intrusion detection algorithm. Our novel algorithm is able todetect attacks in a timely manner and also diagnose the type of attackby classification of different types of attacks. With digital twins,which are a new concept in {ICS}, we have virtual replicas of physicalsystems so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of thephysical systems.

One of those is autonomous driving (AD), which needs to be propped up by integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to improve user acceptance. Strong reliance of proposed solutions on communication and data management, as well as on a variety of complex and heterogeneous architectures and components exposes a range of vulnerabilities. The weaknesses are strongly correlated to dependability, which is crucial factor for success of AD. IoT4CPS, a flagship Austrian project, contributes to improvements in required dependability. It is developing guidelines, methods and tools for safe and secure integration of IoT into AD and corresponding smart production. The project addresses safety and security aspects of AD in a holistic manner. Some of the resulting considerations are described in this paper, alongside possible solutions based on virtualisation through usage of digital twins.},

Once it is deployed, a critical systemcannot be made unavailable for the purpose of simulating a cyber attackand thus it is hard to introduce corrective measures based on actualtest outcomes. On the other hand, a high security posture is requiredfor critical infrastructure and security by design is mandatory for newprojects. Such requirements call for an architectural approach tointroduce security straight from the early development phases. However,the adoption of a systematic design approach does not guarantee thecost-effectiveness of security countermeasures analysis, which is anextremely cumbersome task as the creation of a physical model is oftencostly or impossible.To address these issues, we propose the introduction of a specific viewin the system's architectural blueprint, called the {CybersecurityDigital} Twin. It is an Enterprise Architecture model of the systemspecifically targeted at providing a sound base for simulations in orderto devise proper countermeasures without any outage of the physicalinfrastructure. To provide a proof of concept and demonstrate thepractical viability of the proposed solution, we apply the methodologyto a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System use case, evaluating thesystem security of the obtained solution.},

    ABSTRACT = {Resource constraints in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) result in brute-force attacks, transforming them into a botnet to launch Distributed Denial of Service Attacks. The delayed detection of botnet formation presents challenges in controlling the spread of malicious scripts in other devices and increases the probability of a high-volume cyberattack. In this paper, we propose a secure Blockchain-enabled Digital Framework for the early detection of Bot formation in a Smart Factory environment. A Digital Twin (DT) is designed for a group of devices on the edge layer to collect device data and inspect packet headers using Deep Learning for connections with external unique IP addresses with open connections. Data are synchronized between the DT and a Packet Auditor (PA) for detecting corrupt device data transmission. Smart Contracts authenticate the DT and PA, ensuring malicious nodes do not participate in data synchronization. Botnet spread is prevented using DT certificate revocation. A comparative analysis of the proposed framework with existing studies demonstrates that the synchronization of data between the DT and PA ensures data integrity for the Botnet detection model training. Data privacy is maintained by inspecting only Packet headers, thereby not requiring the decryption of encrypted data.},

This paper attempts to explore a new direction to enhance cyber resilience in the perspective of cybersecurity and Digital Twins. We enumerate definitions of the Digital Twin concept to introduce readers to this disruptive concept. We then explore the existing literature to develop a holistic analysis of the DT's integration into cybersecurity. Our research questions develop a novel roadmap for a promising direction of research, which is worth exploring in the future and is validated by an extensive and systematic survey of recent works.

In this paper, we advance the integration of W3C's Web of Things ({WoT}) standards with {DLTs} and smart contracts, introducing smart contracts as “Digital Twins” of (physical) devices, or whole Cyber-Physical subsystems. Namely, we introduce a {DLT}-based architecture for controlling devices across federated {IoT} systems, securely, reliably, and with full auditability. The proposed architecture provides mass actuation and service composition with notable security properties, such as full auditability, transparency, and high availability. Specifically, a single request, with multiple action parameters and conditions, can trigger the reliable and secure actuation of a large number of possibly physically dispersed actuators.},

However, due to the spatial particularity of this network across land, sea, air, and other levels, it faces the dilemma of being "easy to attack" and "difficult to defend". At the same time, with the acceleration of the wave of digital transformation, the space Internet is increasingly facing software supply chain security risks. Currently, there is no security simulation and verification platform for the whole life cycle of the space Internet. Therefore, in the present study, we design a digital twin-based hyper large scientific infrastructure for the space Internet named Space Spider to realize the ground simulation of all elements of the space Internet and establish an attack and defense environment for the space Internet to support core technology verification. In addition, we also proposed Spiderland, an open experimental platform for space Internet applications and security researchers, to conduct simulation and attack-defense experiments.},

    abstract="In this work, we draft a methodology to build a cyber-security digital twin of a Smart Grid, starting from its architectural blueprint. The idea of a digital twin is not new and has recently been proposed as a means to enable simulations for the purpose of environmental protection where tests on the real system are difficult or expensive. The novelty in our work is in proposing and analyzing the possibility to dynamically align the digital twin with its real counterpart. As a preliminary step toward the synthesis of a Digital Twin for the Smart Grid, we propose the adoption of an architectural view that gets dynamically aligned with the state of the world at deploy and operation time. In this manner, we lay out the basis for a maintenance-aware model, which is at the core of the ``digital twin'' concept. The availability of a digital twin allows the enforcement of policies for the devices when they connect to the Grid. This paves the way for a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), as introduced in this work.",

    abstract = {While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.},

	abstract = {In order to effectively solve the current security problems encountered by smart wireless terminals in the digital twin biological network, to ensure the stable and efﬁcient operation of the wireless communication network. This research aims to reduce the interference attack in the communication network, an interference source location scheme based on Mobile Tracker in the communication process of the Internet of Things ({IoT}) is designed. Firstly, this paper improves Attribute-Based Encryption ({ABE}) to meet the security and overhead requirements of digital twin networking communication. The access control policy is used to encrypt a random key, and the symmetric encryption scheme is used to hide the key. In addition, in the proposed interference source location technology, the inﬂuence of observation noise is reduced based on the principle of unscented Kalman ﬁlter, and the estimated interference source location is modiﬁed by the interference source motion model. In order to further evaluate the performance of the method proposed as the interference source, this paper simulates the jamming attack scenario. The Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}) value of the proposed algorithm is 0.245 m, which is better than the {ErrMin} algorithm (0.313 m), and the number of observation nodes of the proposed algorithm is less than half of the {ErrMin} algorithm. To sum up, satisfactory results can be achieved by taking the Jamming Signal Strength ({JSS}) information as the observation value and estimating the location of the interference source and other state information based on the untracked Kalman ﬁlter algorithm. This research has signiﬁcant value for the secure communication of the digital twins in the {IoT}.},

In this streamline, the digital twin ({DT}) is one of the most cutting-edge technologies of Industry 4.0, providing simulation capabilities to forecast, optimize and estimate states and configurations. In turn, these technological capabilities are encouraging industrial stakeholders to invest in the new paradigm, though an increased focus on the risks involved is really needed. More precisely, the deployment of a {DT} is based on the composition of technologies such as cyber-physical systems, the Industrial Internet of Things, edge computing, virtualization infrastructures, artificial intelligence and big data. However, the confluence of all these technologies and the implicit interaction with the physical counterpart of the {DT} in the real world generate multiple security threats that have not yet been sufficiently studied. In that context, this paper analyzes the current state of the {DT} paradigm and classifies the potential threats associated with it, taking into consideration its functionality layers and the operational requirements in order to achieve a more complete and useful classification. We also provide a preliminary set of security recommendations and approaches that can help to ensure the appropriate and trustworthy use of a {DT}.},

    abstract = {Ever since cyber attacks focused on industrial and critical infrastructure settings, the awareness of the security issues of these systems has increased. These industrial control systems (ICS) mainly focus on operation and availability -- instead of providing general security features. Moreover, the current Industry 4.0 movement aggravates this security gap by connecting the ICS to the enterprise network, which facilitates targeting these systems. Proper system testing can reveal the system's vulnerabilities and provide remedies. However, security measures are usually neglected or addressed after an emerging incident only, which results in high costs. To maximize the benefit of system testing, we argue that it should be carried out as early as possible, especially to render systems secure-by-design. In this work, we propose an approach for introducing security-by-design system testing by the application of a digital twin. A digital twin is able to represent a system virtually along its lifecycle. To enable security-by-design, the simulation capability of digital twin is harnessed to create a prospective environment of a planned system. This allows detecting vulnerabilities before they can emerge in the real-world and providing a adequate risk strategy. Our work shows how security-by-design system testing is anchored in the security applications along a system's lifecycle. Next to proposing a security-by-design system testing approach with digital twins, we implement a digital twin representing a pressure vessel, and demonstrate how to carry out each step of our proposed approach. During this proof-of-concept, we identify vulnerabilities and show how an attacker can compromise the system by manipulating values of the pressure vessel with the potential to cause over-pressure, which, in turn, can result in an explosion of the vessel.},
