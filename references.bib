	abstract = {The digital twin has recently become a popular topic in research related to manufacturing, such as Industry 4.0, the industrial internet of things, and cyber-physical systems. In addition, digital twins are the focus of several research areas: construction, urban management, digital transformation of the economy, medicine, virtual reality, software testing, and others. The concept is not yet fully defined, its scope seems unlimited, and the topic is relatively new; all this can present a barrier to research. The main goal of this paper is to develop a proper methodology for visualizing the digital-twin science landscape using modern bibliometric tools, text-mining and topic-modeling, based on machine learning models—Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The scope of the study includes 8693 publications on the topic selected from the Scopus database, published between January 1993 and September 2022. Keyword co-occurrence analysis and topic-modeling indicate that studies on digital twins are still in the early stage of development. At the same time, the core of the topic is growing, and some topic clusters are emerging. More than 100 topics can be identified; the most popular and fastest-growing topic is ‘digital twins of industrial robots, production lines and objects.’ Further efforts are needed to verify the proposed methodology, which can be achieved by analyzing other research fields.},

In the era of digital revolution of industry, manufacturing processes can benefit from digitalization technologies immensely. Digital twin (DT) is a technology concept that aims to create a digital mirror of a physical system with a constant data flow between two components. This idea can be used for monitoring and optimization of the present system as well as forecasting and estimating future states of it. There have been theoretical and practical studies conducted on DT in manufacturing area. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to summarize the current state of literature and shine a light on open areas for future research. Using a rigorous SLR method, 247 relevant studies from 2015 to 2020 are examined to answer a set of research questions. The current state of DT in manufacturing literature is analyzed and explained with an emphasis on where the future studies may go in this area.},

The IoT cloud provision of the energy cyber-physical and the DT are mathematically formulated. Unlike other cybersecurity frameworks in the literature, the proposed one can mitigate an individual as well as coordinated attacks. The framework is tested on a distributed control system and the security measures are implemented using cloud computing. The physical controllers are implemented using single-board computers. The practical results show that the proposed DT is able to mitigate the coordinated false data injection and the denial of service cyber-attacks.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) have opened the door to a world of unlimited possibilities for implementations in varied sectors in society, but it also has many challenges. One of those challenges is security and privacy. IoT devices are more susceptible to security threats and attacks. Due to constraints of the IoT devices such as area, power, memory, etc., there is a lack of security solutions that are compatible with IoT devices and applications, which is leading this world of securely connected things to the “internet of insecure things.” A promising solution to this problem is going beyond the standard or classical techniques to implementing the security solutions in the hardware of the IoT device.  The integration of emerging technologies in IoT networks, such as machine learning, blockchain, fog/edge/cloud computing, and quantum computing have added more vulnerable points in the network. This paper introduces a comprehensive study on IoT security threats and solutions. Additionally, this survey outlines how emerging technologies such as machine learning and blockchain are integrated in IoT, challenges resulted from this integration, and potential solutions to these challenges. The paper utilizes the 4-layer IoT architecture as a reference to identify security issues with corresponding solutions.},

In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.},

	abstract = {In order to effectively solve the current security problems encountered by smart wireless terminals in the digital twin biological network, to ensure the stable and efficient operation of the wireless communication network. This research aims to reduce the interference attack in the communication network, an interference source location scheme based on Mobile Tracker in the communication process of the Internet of Things (IoT) is designed. Firstly, this paper improves Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) to meet the security and overhead requirements of digital twin networking communication. The access control policy is used to encrypt a random key, and the symmetric encryption scheme is used to hide the key. In addition, in the proposed interference source location technology, the influence of observation noise is reduced based on the principle of unscented Kalman filter, and the estimated interference source location is modified by the interference source motion model. In order to further evaluate the performance of the method proposed as the interference source, this paper simulates the jamming attack scenario. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of the proposed algorithm is 0.245 ​m, which is better than the ErrMin algorithm (0.313 ​m), and the number of observation nodes of the proposed algorithm is less than half of the ErrMin algorithm. To sum up, satisfactory results can be achieved by taking the Jamming Signal Strength (JSS) information as the observation value and estimating the location of the interference source and other state information based on the untracked Kalman filter algorithm. This research has significant value for the secure communication of the digital twins in the IoT.},
