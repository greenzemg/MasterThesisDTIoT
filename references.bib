	abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is one of the most promising enabling technologies for realizing smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0. DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry. This paper also outlines the current challenges and some possible directions for future work.},

	doi = {10.1109/ISGT-Europe47291.2020.9248840},
	abstract = {Power system automation and communication standards are spearheading the power system transition towards a smart grid. IEC 61850 is one such standard, which is widely used for substation automation and protection. It enables real-time communication and data exchange between critical substation automation and protection devices within digital substations. However, IEC 61850 is not cyber secure. In this paper, we demonstrate the dangerous implications of not securing IEC 61850 standard. Cyber attacks may exploit the vulnerabilities of the Sampled Values (SV) and Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocols of IEC 61850. The cyber attacks may be realised by injecting spoofed SV and GOOSE data frames into the substation communication network at the bay level. We demonstrate that such cyber attacks may lead to obstruction or tripping of multiple protective relays. Coordinated cyber attacks against the protection system in digital substations may cause generation and line disconnections, triggering cascading failures in the power grid. This may eventually result in a partial or complete blackout. The attack model, impact on system dynamics and cascading failures are veri ed experimentally through a proposed cyber-physical experimental framework that closely resembles real-world conditions within a digital substation, including Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and protection schemes. It is implemented through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations of commercial relays with a Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS).},

	volume = {2},
	abstract = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including PhD students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. 
Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved
in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research.
The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

In addition, digital twins are the focus of several research areas: construction, urban management, digital transformation of the economy, medicine, virtual reality, software testing, and others. The concept is not yet fully defined, its scope seems unlimited, and the topic is relatively new; all this can present a barrier to research. The main goal of this paper is to develop a proper methodology for visualizing the digital-twin science landscape using modern bibliometric tools, text-mining and topic-modeling, based on machine learning models—Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The scope of the study includes 8693 publications on the topic selected from the Scopus database, published between January 1993 and September 2022. Keyword co-occurrence analysis and topic-modeling indicate that studies on digital twins are still in the early stage of development. At the same time, the core of the topic is growing, and some topic clusters are emerging. More than 100 topics can be identified; the most popular and fastest-growing topic is ‘digital twins of industrial robots, production lines and objects.’ Further efforts are needed to verify the proposed methodology, which can be achieved by analyzing other research fields.},

In the era of digital revolution of industry, manufacturing processes can benefit from digitalization technologies immensely. Digital twin (DT) is a technology concept that aims to create a digital mirror of a physical system with a constant data flow between two components. This idea can be used for monitoring and optimization of the present system as well as forecasting and estimating future states of it. There have been theoretical and practical studies conducted on DT in manufacturing area. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to summarize the current state of literature and shine a light on open areas for future research. Using a rigorous SLR method, 247 relevant studies from 2015 to 2020 are examined to answer a set of research questions.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) have opened the door to a world of unlimited possibilities for implementations in varied sectors in society, but it also has many challenges. One of those challenges is security and privacy. IoT devices are more susceptible to security threats and attacks. Due to constraints of the IoT devices such as area, power, memory, etc., there is a lack of security solutions that are compatible with IoT devices and applications, which is leading this world of securely connected things to the “internet of insecure things.” A promising solution to this problem is going beyond the standard or classical techniques to implementing the security solutions in the hardware of the IoT device.  The integration of emerging technologies in IoT networks, such as machine learning, blockchain, fog/edge/cloud computing, and quantum computing have added more vulnerable points in the network. This paper introduces a comprehensive study on IoT security threats and solutions. Additionally, this survey outlines how emerging technologies such as machine learning and blockchain are integrated in IoT, challenges resulted from this integration, and potential solutions to these challenges.
