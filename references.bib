	abstract = {The continually growing number of security-related autonomous devices require efficient mechanisms to counteract low-cost side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks like differential power analysis. Masking provides a high resistance against SCA at an adjustable level of security. A high level of security, however, goes hand in hand with an increasing demand for fresh randomness which also affects other implementation costs. Since software based masking has other security requirements than masked hardware implementations, the research in these fields have been quite separated from each other over the last ten years. One important practical difference is that recently published software based masking schemes show a lower randomness footprint than hardware masking schemes. In this work we combine existing software and hardware based masking schemes into a unified masking approach (UMA). We demonstrate how UMA can be used to protect software and hardware implementations likewise, and for lower randomness costs especially for hardware implementations. Theoretical considerations as well as practical implementation results are then used to compare this unified masking approach to other schemes from different perspectives and at different levels of security.},

	abstract = {In 2015, Todo introduced a property of multisets of a finite field called the division property. It is then used by Todo in an attack against the S7 S-box of the MISTY1 cipher. This paper provides a complete mathematical analysis of the division property. The tool we use is the discrete Fourier transform. We relate the division property to the natural concept of the degree of a subset of a finite field. This indeed provides a characterization of multisets satisfying the division property. In 2015, Sun et al. gave some properties related to the division property. In this paper we give a complete characterization and reprove many of their results. We show that the division property is actually the dual of the degree of-products of the inverse S-box and show these two characteristics are affine invariants. We then propose a very efficient way to check vulnerability of a given S-box against attacks of this type. We also reprove some recent interesting results using the method based on the discrete Fourier transform. We finally check whether the S-boxes of the candidate ciphers in the CAESAR competition are vulnerable against attacks based on the division property.},

Since it was published in 2014 and selected as the first choice for resource-constrained environments of the CAESAR portfolio in 2019, there was already a substantial body of publications on Ascon’s security before the beginning of the NIST LWC project. In this talk, we provide an overview of recent third-party cryptanalysis results as well as our own work on new security bounds. We first focus on our efforts to improve the bounds for security against differential and linear cryptanalysis with new Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) models. We find bounds for 4 and 6 rounds of the permutation which, while probably not tight, reinforce confidence in the security of Ascon, Ascon-Hash, and Ascon-Xof against differential and linear attacks with respect to the security claim. We also discuss the implications of these bounds for the recently proposed MAC variants based on the Ascon permutation. Additionally, we use a similar  SAT model to provide differential bounds...},

Data has become more ubiquitous with the increase in the development of mobile and wireless networking technologies. Also, due to high expectations for productivity improvement, efficiency, and enabling innovative service through collaborative means, IoT is attracting much attention. CPS is the integration of computational objects in fitting together with the corporal biosphere and its procedures. CPSs are complicated manufacturing systems with the goal to combine and harmonize mechanism biosphere and industrial capability to the cyber computational space. Nevertheless, having thorough interconnectivity and a computational platform is essential for a practicable application of CPSs and smart factories. Smart manufacturing, also known as Industry 4.0 or Industry Internet of Things (IIoT), is increasingly becoming the common goal of various industrial and national strategies. For a better implementation of smart manufacturing, smart interconnection is one of the most significant issues. Current technologies, however, are not yet completely equipped for smart interconnection while working with heterogeneous hardware, fast setup, and delivery, as well as online service generation. In this chapter, the effects of IoT technology and CPS in the advancement and awareness of real-life smart manufacturing is addressed. An integrated IoT and CPS framework is recommended as a specification for researchers and industries toward the full realization of the potentials of IoT with CPS in the development of Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing technologies.},

	abstract = {A new wave of industrial technology has emerged in the form of Industry 4.0, which has seen a progression from electronic devices and IT (Information Technology) systems that automate production advance to a new revolution of Cyber-Physical Production Systems used for Smart Manufacturing and Smart Factories via IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things). As more and more devices are becoming connected and networked to allow for Smart Manufacturing to take place the number of data sources significantly increases as a result. Real-time Information is then becoming increasingly interlinked across multiple industries for a more efficient productivity process and a reduction in cost. Aside from Smart manufacturing and factories, Industry 4.0 has already seen huge advances in infrastructure management, energy management, transportation and building and home automation. With such industries relying so heavily on real-time data from connected sensors the security of these systems are at risk due to the reliance on low-latency and reliable communication for critical processes. The increase of interconnected networks and devices across the Internet significantly increases the amount of entry points into these systems, increasing their vulnerability and allowing outsiders to take advantage of any weaknesses within them. This has already been highlighted by the events of Stuxnet, Havex, Black Energy and the German Steel Mill that targeted ICS (Industrial Control Systems) and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) Systems causing catastrophic results. The use of SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) services, IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems), IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems) and firewalls may be implemented within ICS but only operate on the perimeters of their networks or segmented networks and not at the lower operational level where critical processes rely on speed and availability simply because by doing so could introduce latency between critical processes. When events do occur, regardless of whether an incident is accidental or deliberate, an immediate incident response should take place. This chapter focusses on the forensic challenges and analysis of the physical infrastructure that underpins the systems operating within IIoT. It discusses the development of SCADA system architecture over the past few decades and how it has arrived at IIoT, creating the new generation of SCADA systems. The chapter then discusses the current available tools that exist that can help carry out a forensic investigation of a SCADA system operating within IIoT space before closing with a suggested SCADA Incident Response Model.},

	abstract = {Various communication protocols are currently used in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the protocols that are already standardized by ISO is MQTT protocol (ISO / IEC 20922: 2016). Many IoT developers use this protocol because of its minimal bandwidth requirement and low memory consumption. Sometimes, IoT device sends confidential data that should only be accessed by authorized people or devices. Unfortunately, the MQTT protocol only provides authentication for the security mechanism which, by default, does not encrypt the data in transit thus data privacy, authentication, and data integrity become problems in MQTT implementation. This paper discusses several reasons on why there are many IoT system that does not implement adequate security mechanism. Next, it also demonstrates and analyzes how we can attack this protocol easily using several attack scenarios. Finally, after the vulnerabilities of this protocol have been examined, we can improve our security awareness especially in MQTT protocol and then implement security mechanism in our MQTT system to prevent such attack.},

The paper reports experiences with applying one such approach, the practice of systematic literature review, to the published studies relevant to topics within the software engineering domain. The systematic literature review process is summarised, a number of reviews being undertaken by the authors and others are described and some lessons about the applicability of this practice to software engineering are extracted. The basic systematic literature review process seems appropriate to software engineering and the preparation and validation of a review protocol in advance of a review activity is especially valuable. The paper highlights areas where some adaptation of the process to accommodate the domain-specific characteristics of software engineering is needed as well as areas where improvements to current software engineering infrastructure and practices would enhance its applicability. In particular, infrastructure support provided by software engineering indexing databases is inadequate. Also, the quality of abstracts is poor; it is usually not possible to judge the relevance of a study from a review of the abstract alone.},

	abstract = {Power system automation and communication standards are spearheading the power system transition towards a smart grid. IEC 61850 is one such standard, which is widely used for substation automation and protection. It enables real-time communication and data exchange between critical substation automation and protection devices within digital substations. However, IEC 61850 is not cyber secure. In this paper, we demonstrate the dangerous implications of not securing IEC 61850 standard. Cyber attacks may exploit the vulnerabilities of the Sampled Values (SV) and Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocols of IEC 61850. The cyber attacks may be realised by injecting spoofed SV and GOOSE data frames into the substation communication network at the bay level. We demonstrate that such cyber attacks may lead to obstruction or tripping of multiple protective relays. Coordinated cyber attacks against the protection system in digital substations may cause generation and line disconnections, triggering cascading failures in the power grid. This may eventually result in a partial or complete blackout. The attack model, impact on system dynamics and cascading failures are veri ed experimentally through a proposed cyber-physical experimental framework that closely resembles real-world conditions within a digital substation, including Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and protection schemes. It is implemented through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations of commercial relays with a Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS).},

In this article, we discuss how a digitaltwin replication model and corresponding security architecture can beused to allow data sharing and control of security-critical processes.We identify design-driving security requirements for digital twin baseddata sharing and control. We show that the proposed statesynchronization design meets the expected digital twin synchronizationrequirements and give a high-level design and evaluation of othersecurity components of the architecture. We also make performanceevaluations of a proof of concept for protected software upgrade usingthe proposed digital twin design. Our new security framework provides afoundation for future research work in this promising new area.},

	volume = {2},
	abstract = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including PhD students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. 
Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved
in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research.
The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

In addition, digital twins are the focus of several research areas: construction, urban management, digital transformation of the economy, medicine, virtual reality, software testing, and others. The concept is not yet fully defined, its scope seems unlimited, and the topic is relatively new; all this can present a barrier to research. The main goal of this paper is to develop a proper methodology for visualizing the digital-twin science landscape using modern bibliometric tools, text-mining and topic-modeling, based on machine learning models—Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The scope of the study includes 8693 publications on the topic selected from the Scopus database, published between January 1993 and September 2022. Keyword co-occurrence analysis and topic-modeling indicate that studies on digital twins are still in the early stage of development. At the same time, the core of the topic is growing, and some topic clusters are emerging. More than 100 topics can be identified; the most popular and fastest-growing topic is ‘digital twins of industrial robots, production lines and objects.’ Further efforts are needed to verify the proposed methodology, which can be achieved by analyzing other research fields.},

In the era of digital revolution of industry, manufacturing processes can benefit from digitalization technologies immensely. Digital twin (DT) is a technology concept that aims to create a digital mirror of a physical system with a constant data flow between two components. This idea can be used for monitoring and optimization of the present system as well as forecasting and estimating future states of it. There have been theoretical and practical studies conducted on DT in manufacturing area. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to summarize the current state of literature and shine a light on open areas for future research. Using a rigorous SLR method, 247 relevant studies from 2015 to 2020 are examined to answer a set of research questions. The current state of DT in manufacturing literature is analyzed and explained with an emphasis on where the future studies may go in this area.},

The IoT cloud provision of the energy cyber-physical and the DT are mathematically formulated. Unlike other cybersecurity frameworks in the literature, the proposed one can mitigate an individual as well as coordinated attacks. The framework is tested on a distributed control system and the security measures are implemented using cloud computing. The physical controllers are implemented using single-board computers.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) have opened the door to a world of unlimited possibilities for implementations in varied sectors in society, but it also has many challenges. One of those challenges is security and privacy. IoT devices are more susceptible to security threats and attacks. Due to constraints of the IoT devices such as area, power, memory, etc., there is a lack of security solutions that are compatible with IoT devices and applications, which is leading this world of securely connected things to the “internet of insecure things.” A promising solution to this problem is going beyond the standard or classical techniques to implementing the security solutions in the hardware of the IoT device.  The integration of emerging technologies in IoT networks, such as machine learning, blockchain, fog/edge/cloud computing, and quantum computing have added more vulnerable points in the network. This paper introduces a comprehensive study on IoT security threats and solutions. Additionally, this survey outlines how emerging technologies such as machine learning and blockchain are integrated in IoT, challenges resulted from this integration, and potential solutions to these challenges. The paper utilizes the 4-layer IoT architecture as a reference to identify security issues with corresponding solutions.},

In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.},
