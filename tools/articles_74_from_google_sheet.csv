,ELEGANT: Security of Critical Infrastructures With Digital Twins,"Sousa, Bruno and Arieiro, Miguel and Pereira, Vasco and Correia, Joaoand Lourenco, Nuno and Cruz, Tiago",IEEE ACCESS,2021,ISI Web of Science,107574-107588,9,"The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern
regarding the development of security monitoring and management
mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in
ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not
easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the
natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions
implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical
objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security
analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed
in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises
deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return
will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support
infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data
collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the
acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to
design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures,
developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are
built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic
Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection
processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning
models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The
validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of
the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using
cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the
projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go
OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS
(Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate
that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins
have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and
Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of
data are generated.",Article,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3100708,,"Sousa, B (Corresponding Author), Univ Coimbra, CISUC, DEI, Polo Pinhal Marroco 2, P-303290 Coimbra, Portugal.Sousa, Bruno; Arieiro, Miguel; Pereira, Vasco; Correia, Joao; Lourenco, Nuno; Cruz, Tiago, Univ Coimbra, CISUC, DEI, Polo Pinhal Marroco 2, P-303290 Coimbra, Portugal.",,Security; Digital twin; Monitoring; Integrated circuits; Processcontrol; SCADA systems; Analytical models; Digital Twins; SCADA;pipelines; security; programmable logic controllers; DTaaS,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,2169-3536,English,,,44936.59786,44939.79861,Linatek,Linatek,Accepted,
,Towards situational aware cyber-physical systems: A security-enhancinguse case of blockchain-based digital twins,"Suhail, Sabah and Malik, Saif Ur Rehman and Jurdak, Raja and Hussain,Rasheed and Matulevicius, Raimundas and Svetinovic, Davor",COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY,2022,ISI Web of Science,,141,"The complexity of cyberattacks in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) calls
for a mechanism that can evaluate critical infrastructures' operational
behaviour and security without affecting the operation of live systems.
In this regard, Digital Twins (DTs) provide actionable insights through
monitoring, simulating, predicting, and optimizing the state of CPSs.
Through the use cases, including system testing and training, detecting
system misconfigurations, and security testing, DTs strengthen the
security of CPSs throughout the product lifecycle. However, such
benefits of DTs depend on an assumption about data integrity and
security. Data trustworthiness becomes more critical while integrating
multiple components among different DTs owned by various stakeholders to
provide an aggregated view of the complex physical system. This article
envisions a blockchain-based DT framework as Trusted Twins for Securing
Cyber-Physical Systems (TTS-CPS). With the automotive industry as a CPS
use case, we demonstrate the viability of the TTS-CPS framework through
a proof of concept. To utilize reliable system specification data for
building the process knowledge of DTs, we ensure the trustworthiness of
data-generating sources through Integrity Checking Mechanisms (ICMs).
Additionally, Safety and Security (S\&S) rules evaluated during
simulation are stored and retrieved from the blockchain, thereby
establishing more understanding and confidence in the decisions made by
the underlying systems. Finally, we perform formal verification of the

This research aims to reduce the interference attack in the communication network, an interference source location scheme based on Mobile Tracker in the communication process of the Internet of Things (IoT) is designed. Firstly, this paper improves Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) to meet the security and overhead requirements of digital twin networking communication. The access control policy is used to encrypt a random key, and the symmetric encryption scheme is used to hide the key. In addition, in the proposed interference source location technology, the inﬂuence of observation noise is reduced based on the principle of unscented Kalman ﬁlter, and the estimated interference source location is modiﬁed by the interference source motion model. In order to further evaluate the performance of the method proposed as the interference source, this paper simulates the jamming attack scenario. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of the proposed algorithm is 0.245 m, which is better than the ErrMin algorithm (0.313 m), and the number of observation nodes of the proposed algorithm is less than half of the ErrMin algorithm. To sum up, satisfactory results can be achieved by taking the Jamming Signal Strength (JSS) information as the observation value and estimating the location of the interference source and other state information based on the untracked Kalman ﬁlter algorithm.

A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted. The paper provides a deep insight into the technology, lists design goals and objectives, highlights design challenges and limitations across industries, discusses research and commercial developments, provides its applications and use cases, offers case studies in industry, infrastructure and healthcare, lists main service providers and stakeholders, and covers developments to date, as well as viable research dimensions for future developments in DTs.  © 1998-2012 IEEE.",Article,10.1109/COMST.2022.3208773,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139416099&doi=10.1109%2fCOMST.2022.3208773&partnerID=40&md5=3385e46ba470f59915fb9ed37169c7b1,,5G; digital transformation; Digital twin; industry 4.0; smart manufacturing; structural health monitoring,Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; Distributed computer systems; Firmware; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Network security; Real time systems; Surveys; Systems engineering; Virtual reality; 5g; Digital transformation; Emerging technologies; Enabling technologies; Future prospects; Market researches; Smart manufacturing; Solid modelling; Technology challenges; Tutorial; Data visualization,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1553877X,English,"Cited by: 3; All Open Access, Green Open Access",,44936.5983,44940.70508,Linatek,Linatek,Accepted,

Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution.

As people become gradually inalienable to smart home infrastructures, their security conditions are getting more and more closely tied to everyone&#x2019;s privacy and safety. In this paper, we consider smart apps, either malicious ones with evil intentions or benign ones with logic errors, that can cause property loss or even physical sufferings to the user when being executed in a smart home environment and interacting with human activities and environmental changes. Unfortunately, current preventive measures rely on permissionbased access control, failing to provide ideal protections against such threats due to the nature of their rigid designs. In this paper, we propose CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based security framework that adopts a fundamentally new concept of protecting the smart home system by letting any sequence of app commands to be executed in a virtual smart home system, in which a deep-q network (DQN) is used to predict if the sequence could lead to a risky consequence. CommandFence is composed of an Interposition Layer to interpose app commands and an Emulation Layer to figure out whether they can cause any risky smart home state if correlating with possible human activities and environmental changes. We fully implemented our CommandFence implementation and tested against 553 official SmartApps on the Samsung SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 potentially dangerous ones, with 31 of them reported to be problematic the first time to our best knowledge. Moreover, We tested our CommandFence on the 10 malicious SmartApps created by [1] and successfully identified 7 of them as risky, with the missed ones actually only causing smartphone information leak (not harmful to the smart home system). We also tested CommandFence against the 17 benign SmartApps with logic errors developed by [2] and achieved a 100 CommandFence incurs a neglectable overhead of 0.1675 seconds.

Its main use is for enabling attack simulations and evaluation of countermeasures, without causing outage of the physical system. However, the use of a DT is considered foremost as a facilitator of system operation rather than an integral part of its architecture design. In this work, we introduce a specific architecture view in the system representation, called Cybersecurity View. From it, we derive a cybersecurity Digital Twin as part of the security-by-design practice for Industrial Automation and Control Systems used in Critical Infrastructures. Not only this digital twin serves the purpose of simulating cyber-attacks and devising countermeasures, but its design and function are also directly tied to the architecture model of the system for which the cybersecurity requirements are posed. Moreover, this holds regardless of whether the model is generated as part of the development cycle or through an empirical observation of the system as-is. With this, we enable the identification of adequate cybersecurity measures for the system, while improving the overall system design.

We use a Signaling Game with Evidence (SGE) to find the optimal attack and defense strategies. Our analytical results show that the proposed defense strategies can mitigate the impact of the attack on the physical estimation and guarantee the stability of the CPSs.

monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support

approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the

While the technology is available and deployment has a low barrier of entry in future applications, proper security frameworks are still at infancy stage and are being developed to fit varied implementations and device architectures. Further, the need for edge centric mechanisms are critical to offer security in real time smart connected applications with minimal or negligible overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of data security by using multiple device shadows (aka digital twins) for a single physical object. These twins are paramount to separate data among different virtual objects based on tags assigned on-the-fly, and are used to limit access to different data points by authorized users/applications only. The novelty of the proposed architecture resides in the attachment of dynamic tags to key-value pairs reported by physical devices in the system. We further examine the advantages of tagging data in a digital twin system, and the performance impacts of the proposed data separation scheme. The proposed solution is deployed at the edge, supporting low latency and real time security mechanisms with minimal overhead, and is light-weight as reflected by captured performance metrics.  © 2021 IEEE.",Conference paper,10.1109/TPSISA52974.2021.00008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128733706&doi=10.1109%2fTPSISA52974.2021.00008&partnerID=40&md5=37215811b3697a1ed7152025191de3b2,,Access Control; Data Security; Digital Twins; Edge Centric; IoT; Sharing; Tag Based Access Control,Internet of things; Data Sharing; Edge centric; Future applications; Implementation architecture; Industrial environments; Secure data; Security frameworks; Sharing; Tag based access control; Tag-based; Access control,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,"Cited by: 1; Conference name: 3rd IEEE International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent Systems and Applications, TPS-ISA 2021; Conference date: 13 December 2021 through 15 December 2021; Conference code: 178763; All Open Access, Green Open Access",,44936.5983,44940.80591,Linatek,Linatek,Accepted,
,Employing Digital Twins for Security-by-Design System Testing,"Dietz, Marietheres and Hageman, Leon and Von Hornung, Constantin and Pernul, Günther",SaT-CPS 2022 - Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems,2022,Scopus,97 – 106,,"Ever since cyber attacks focused on industrial and critical infrastructure settings, the awareness of the security issues of these systems has increased. These industrial control systems (ICS) mainly focus on operation and availability - instead of providing general security features. Moreover, the current Industry 4.0 movement aggravates this security gap by connecting the ICS to the enterprise network, which facilitates targeting these systems. Proper system testing can reveal the system's vulnerabilities and provide remedies. However, security measures are usually neglected or addressed after an emerging incident only, which results in high costs. To maximize the benefit of system testing, we argue that it should be carried out as early as possible, especially to render systems secure-by-design. In this work, we propose an approach for introducing security-by-design system testing by the application of a digital twin. A digital twin is able to represent a system virtually along its lifecycle. To enable security-by-design, the simulation capability of digital twin is harnessed to create a prospective environment of a planned system. This allows detecting vulnerabilities before they can emerge in the real-world and providing a adequate risk strategy. Our work shows how security-by-design system testing is anchored in the security applications along a system's lifecycle. Next to proposing a security-by-design system testing approach with digital twins, we implement a digital twin representing a pressure vessel, and demonstrate how to carry out each step of our proposed approach. During this proof-of-concept, we identify vulnerabilities and show how an attacker can compromise the system by manipulating values of the pressure vessel with the potential to cause over-pressure, which, in turn, can result in an explosion of the vessel. © 2022 Owner/Author.",Conference paper,10.1145/3510547.3517929,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129899550&doi=10.1145%2f3510547.3517929&partnerID=40&md5=312a568bf27d40cb009ce4fc05977306,,Digital twin; Industrial vulnerabilities; Security-by-design; System testing,Availability; Cybersecurity; Intelligent control; Life cycle; Pressure vessels; Security systems; 'current; Design systems; Enterprise networks; Industrial control systems; Industrial vulnerability; Security features; Security gap; Security issues; Security-by-design; System testing; Network security,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,English,"Cited by: 0; Conference name: 2nd ACM Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems, SaT-CPS 2022; Conference date: 27 April 2022; Conference code: 179034; All Open Access, Bronze Open Access, Green Open Access",,44936.5983,44940.7985,Linatek,Linatek,Accepted,

For instance, detecting early symptoms of cyber attacks may speed up the incident response process and mitigate consequences of attacks (e.g., business interruption, safety hazards). However, attaining a full understanding of the cyber situation may be challenging, given the complexity of CPSs and the ever-changing threat landscape. In particular, CPSs typically need to be continuously operational, may be sensitive to active scanning, and often provide only limited in-depth analysis capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize the concept of digital twins for enhancing cyber situational awareness. Digital twins, i.e., virtual replicas of systems, can run in parallel to their physical counterparts and allow deep inspection of their behavior without the risk of disrupting operational technology services. This paper reports our work in progress to develop a cyber situational awareness framework based on digital twins that provides a profound, holistic, and current view on the cyber situation that CPSs are in.

control systems is well-known. Once it is deployed, a critical system
cannot be made unavailable for the purpose of simulating a cyber attack
and thus it is hard to introduce corrective measures based on actual
test outcomes. On the other hand, a high security posture is required
for critical infrastructure and security by design is mandatory for new
projects. Such requirements call for an architectural approach to
introduce security straight from the early development phases. However,
the adoption of a systematic design approach does not guarantee the
cost-effectiveness of security countermeasures analysis, which is an
extremely cumbersome task as the creation of a physical model is often
costly or impossible.
To address these issues, we propose the introduction of a specific view
in the system's architectural blueprint, called the Cybersecurity
Digital Twin. It is an Enterprise Architecture model of the system
specifically targeted at providing a sound base for simulations in order
to devise proper countermeasures without any outage of the physical

The related technologies of quantum communication are introduced to improve network communication. Firstly, the key DTs technologies in the construction of IIoT are expounded. Also, the characteristics of quantum communication are analyzed. Secondly, a channel encryption scheme based on quantum communication is proposed to ensure the communication security of IIoT. The scheme uses the five-particle entanglement state and two-particle bell state as entanglement channels to realize two-particle quantum teleportation. Finally, an Adaptive Key Residue algorithm is proposed based on the quantum key distribution mechanism. The algorithm verification suggests that the success rate of service distribution decreases with the increase in network load. When the service load reaches 1000, the Adaptive Key Residue algorithm can maintain a success rate of service distribution in the network higher than 0.6. Besides, the success rate of service distribution increases with the growth of the total key generation rate V and the key pool capacity C.

creation in many domains. The automotive industry is impacted on by
several additional trends. One of those is autonomous driving (AD),
which needs to be propped up by integration of Internet of Things (IoT)
and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to improve user acceptance. Strong
reliance of proposed solutions on communication and data management, as
well as on a variety of complex and heterogeneous architectures and
components exposes a range of vulnerabilities. The weaknesses are
strongly correlated to dependability, which is crucial factor for
success of AD. IoT4CPS, a flagship Austrian project, contributes to
improvements in required dependability. It is developing guidelines,
methods and tools for safe and secure integration of IoT into AD and
corresponding smart production. The project addresses safety and
security aspects of AD in a holistic manner. Some of the resulting
considerations are described in this paper, alongside possible solutions
based on virtualisation through usage of digital twins.",Proceedings Paper,10.1007/978-3-030-28005-5\_32,,"Veledar, O (Corresponding Author), AVL List GmbH, Hans List Pl, A-8020 Graz, Austria.Veledar, Omar, AVL List GmbH, Hans List Pl, A-8020 Graz, Austria.Damjanovic-Behrendt, Violeta, Salzburg Res, Jakob Haringer Str 5-3, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.Macher, Georg, Graz Univ Technol, Inffeldgasse 16, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",,Autonomous driving; Digital Twin; Safety; Security; Dependability;Trustworthy; Connectivity; IoT; Internet of Things,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,1865-0929,English,"26th Systems, Software and Services Process Improvement (EuroSPI)Conference, Edinburgh, SCOTLAND, SEP 18-20, 2019",,44936.59786,44940.48639,Linatek,Linatek,Accepted,
,Harnessing Digital Twin Security Simulations for systematic Cyber ThreatIntelligence,"Dietz, Marietheres and Schlette, Daniel and Pernul, Gunther",,2022,ISI Web of Science,789-797,,"Understanding cybersecurity threats, attacks, and incidents is crucial
for organizations to perform preventive or reactive measures.
Nevertheless, detailed Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is reluctantly
shared. Digital twins, the virtual counterparts of real-world assets,
offer security simulation capabilities. The simulation of attack
scenarios on industrial control systems (ICS) with digital twins yields
valuable threat information. In our work, we outline the systematic
steps towards a structured threat report starting with digital twin
security simulations: We first present the course of action and define
formal requirements for framework deployment. We then conduct an attack
simulation with a prototypical digital twin application to evaluate our
framework. Using the STIX2.1 standard, we assist CTI generation by
providing utility tools guiding through the process steps. Our
experimental results show that a STIX2.1 CTI report can be
systematically constructed with the opportunity to customize according
to the use case at hand. Adding digital twin security simulations to the
list of CTI sources can provide shareable CTI and help organizations
improve their security posture.",Proceedings Paper,10.1109/COMPSAC54236.2022.00129,,"Dietz, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Regensburg, Chair Informat Syst, Regensburg, Germany.Dietz, Marietheres; Schlette, Daniel; Pernul, Gunther, Univ Regensburg, Chair Informat Syst, Regensburg, Germany.",,digital twin; cyber threat intelligence; simulation; security analysis,IEEE,,English,"46th Annual IEEE-Computer-Society International Computers, Software, andApplications Conference (COMPSAC) - Computers, Software, andApplications in an Uncertain World, ELECTR NETWORK, JUN 27-JUL 01, 2022",,44936.59786,44940.45501,Linatek,Linatek,Accepted,
,Using Cyber Digital Twins for Automated Automotive Cybersecurity Testing,"Marksteiner, Stefan and Bronfman, Slava and Wolf, Markus and Lazebnik,Eddie",,2021,ISI Web of Science,123-128,,"Cybersecurity testing of automotive systems has become a practical
necessity, with the wide adoption of advanced driving assistance
functions and vehicular communications. These functionalities require
the integration of information and communication technologies that not
only allow for a plethora of on-the-fly configuration abilities, but
also provide a huge surface for attacks. Theses circumstances have also
been recognized by standardization and regulation bodies, making the
need for not only proper cybersecurity engineering but also proving the
effectiveness of security measures by verification and validation
through testing also a formal necessity. In order to keep pace with the
rapidly growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular
systems, novel approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a
methodology to create and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in
a black box setting by using pattern matching-based binary analysis and
translation mechanisms to formal attack descriptions as well as
model-checking techniques. The approach is intended to generate
meaningful attack vectors on a system with next-to-zero a priori
knowledge.",Proceedings Paper,10.1109/EuroSPW54576.2021.00020,,"Marksteiner, S (Corresponding Author), AVL List GmbH, Graz, Austria.Marksteiner, Stefan; Wolf, Markus, AVL List GmbH, Graz, Austria.Bronfman, Slava; Lazebnik, Eddie, Cybellum Ltd, Tel Aviv, Israel.",,automotive; cybersecurity; testing; digital twin; model-based testing,IEEE,,English,"6th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S and P),ELECTR NETWORK, SEP 06-10, 2021",,44936.59786,44940.37404,Linatek,Linatek,Accepted,

real system. Digital twins can be applied in power systems in a variety
of ways. But at present, the application of digital twin still stays on
the application of the whole product life cycle. This paper proposes a
new real-time interactive power system simulation architecture based on
