AB  - Industry 4.0 is having an increasingly positive impact on the value chain by modernizing and optimizing the production and distribution processes. In this streamline, the digital twin (DT) is one of the most cutting-edge technologies of Industry 4.0, providing simulation capabilities to forecast, optimize and estimate states and configurations. In turn, these technological capabilities are encouraging industrial stakeholders to invest in the new paradigm, though an increased focus on the risks involved is really needed. More precisely, the deployment of a DT is based on the composition of technologies such as cyber-physical systems, the Industrial Internet of Things, edge computing, virtualization infrastructures, artificial intelligence and big data. However, the confluence of all these technologies and the implicit interaction with the physical counterpart of the DT in the real world generate multiple security threats that have not yet been sufficiently studied. In that context, this paper analyzes the current state of the DT paradigm and classifies the potential threats associated with it, taking into consideration its functionality layers and the operational requirements in order to achieve a more complete and useful classification. We also provide a preliminary set of security recommendations and approaches that can help to ensure the appropriate and trustworthy use of a DT.

AB  - Security Operations Centers (SOCs) provide a holistic view of a company’s security operations. While aiming to harness this potential, companies are lacking sufficiently skilled cybersecurity analysts. One approach to meet this demand is to create a cyber range to equip potential analysts with the skills required. The digital twin paradigm offers great benefit by providing a realistic virtual environment to create a cyber range. However, to the best of our knowledge, tapping this potential to train SOC analysts has not been attempted yet. To address this research gap, a concept of a digital twin-based cyber range for SOC analysts is proposed and implemented. As part of the virtual training environment, several attacks against an industrial system are simulated. Being provided with a SIEM system that displays the real-time log data, the trainees solve increasingly complex tasks in which they have to detect the attacks performed against the system. Thereby, they learn how to interact with a SIEM system and create rules that correlate events aiming to detect security incidents. To evaluate the implemented cyber range, a comprehensive user study demonstrates a significant increase of knowledge within SIEM-related topics among the participants. Additionally, it indicates that the cyber range was subjectively perceived as a positive learning experience by the participants.

AB  - While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

AB  - Internet of Everything (IoE) applications such as haptics, human-computer interaction, and extended reality, using the sixth-generation (6G) of wireless systems have diverse requirements in terms of latency, reliability, data rate, and user-defined performance metrics. Therefore, enabling IoE applications over 6G requires a new framework that can be used to manage, operate, and optimize the 6G wireless system and its underlying IoE services. Such a new framework for 6G can be based on digital twins. Digital twins use a virtual representation of the 6G physical system along with the associated algorithms (e.g., machine learning, optimization), communication technologies (e.g., millimeter-wave and terahertz communication), computing systems (e.g., edge computing and cloud computing), as well as privacy and security-related technologists (e.g., blockchain). First, we present the key design requirements for enabling 6G through the use of a digital twin. Next, the architectural components and trends such as edge-based twins, cloud-based-twins, and edge-cloud-based twins are presented. Furthermore, we provide a comparative description of various twins. Finally, we outline and recommend guidelines for several future research directions.

AB  - The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has made it challenging for large scale data collection, in particular for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based computer vision systems. Additionally, there are numerous circumstances where security, privacy, and limitations pertaining to the accessibility of the required equipment make it arduous to validate computer vision systems with real-world datasets. In this paper, we investigated the possibilities of using synthetic datasets, generated from Virtual Environments (VE) for training and validation of CNN models. We present two use cases where the above-mentioned circumstances play a vital role in preparing the datasets and validating the model with large-scale datasets. By developing and leveraging a three-dimensional Digital Twin (DT), we produce large scale datasets for validating social distancing in workspaces; and in the context of semi-autonomous vehicles, we evaluate how a CNN-based object detection model would perform in an Indian road scenario.

AU  - Liu, Jiawen

AB  - The vehicular networks are vulnerable to cyber security attacks due to the vehicles’ large attack surface. Anomaly detection is an effective means to deal with this kind of attack. Due to the vehicle’s limited computation resources, the vehicular edge network (VEN) has been proposed provide additional computing power while meeting the demand of low latency. However, the time-space limitation of edge computing prevents the vehicle data from being fully utilized. To solve this problem, a digital twin vehicular edge networks (DITVEN) is proposed. The distributed trust evaluation is established based on the trust chain transitivity and aggregation for edge computing units and digital twins to ensure the credibility of digital twins. The local reachability density and outlier factor are introduced for the time awareness anomaly detection. The curl and divergence based elements are utilized to achieve the space awareness anomaly detection. The mutual trust evaluation and anomaly detection is implemented for performance analysis, which indicates that the proposed scheme is suitable for digital twin vehicular applications.

AB  - This article presents a method to create a digital twin for sauna. The digital twin deploys a data analytics method based on fuzzy similarity measure for data summarization to provide real-time actionable instructions. The intended outcome of the digital twin is enhanced safety and improved sauna experience. In this research, we collected the data through experimentation with a testbed and interviews. Our implemented digital twin simplifies the readings of nineteen sensors into a single graphical form for the user that illustrates the overall sauna conditions and assists the sauna manager with condition optimization. Results illustrated the effectiveness of the digital twin in achieving an enhanced sauna condition for the users and providing the sauna manager with a decision support system. The method of creating the digital twin described in this article has potential implications for the condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhancing the safety and security of complex systems.

AB  - A security decoupling approach for IoT device communications is presented, based on a Digital Twin with runtime verification capabilities. The solution proposed assumes that a local agent (security module) can be deployed to the IoT device by the IoT server. The runtime verification approach implemented in the Digital Twin detects possible violations of protected communications from either a remote device or a local compromised process and provides timely and valuable information for countering a potential cyber-security attack. Moreover, only a subset of the observed traffic needs to be monitored, which induces negligible overhead and allows deploying the Digital Twin in IoT devices with limited computational resources. Runtime verification was implemented by adopting a rule-based approach for monitoring parametric events, i.e. the packets that carry data.

AB  - With the recent advancements in blockchain technology, it has become obvious that this technology is not just for crypto-currencies but instead can be used as a decentralized tool for better accountability. Blockchain has the capacity to transform the industries disruptively as it presents new features like smart contracts, tokenization of content, eliminating counterfeit products, supply chain improvement, digital twins, and end-to-end security. This paper presents a blockchain-based model for distributed and collaborative digital twin environments which is becoming indispensable in new “Any 4.0” era. The proposed model includes a public or private authority in the digital twin ecosystem providing non-repudiation of blockchain transactions, holistic security and privacy preservation. The proposed technique is based on the “X-by-design” and “X-as-a-service” principles which can be discussed as a novel model for better security, accountability and integrity in decentralized mechanisms. In order to elucidate, two case studies are described where the digital twin operations, stakeholders’ activities and regarding transactions are stored on a blockchain.

AB  - Information is the basis of decision security. In the era of big data, information is everywhere, and risks are everywhere. Information leakage incidents are frequently exposed, bringing many hidden dangers to users. While artificial intelligence brings convenience to people, it also inevitably brings crises. This paper aims to study the information security laws and regulations of users in the intelligent age and find the reasons for the leakage of user information. This paper proposes to calculate decision risk with the help of mobile edge computing technology. It builds a digital twin risk simulation model to make better risk decisions. The experimental results of this paper show that improving relevant laws and regulations can significantly reduce decision-making risks and improve decision-making efficiency by 20%.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) technologies have emerged as a solution for real-time data-driven modeling of cyber physical systems (CPS) using the vast amount of data available by Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In this position paper, we elucidate unique characteristics and capabilities of a DT framework that enables realization of such promises as online learning of a physical environment, real-time monitoring of assets, Monte Carlo heuristic search for predictive prevention, on-policy, and off-policy reinforcement learning in real-time. We establish a conceptual layered architecture for a DT framework with decentralized implementation on cloud computing and enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) services for modeling and decision-making processes. The DT framework separates the control functions, deployed as a system of logically centralized process, from the physical devices under control, much like software-defined networking (SDN) in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. To clarify the significance of DT in lowering the risk of development and deployment of innovative technologies on existing system, we discuss the application of implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) as a necessary security framework in future data-driven communication networks.

AB  - With the rapid development and application of internet technology, people are gradually entering a state of digital life. However, it is difficult for digital assets to be circulated with a unified standard protocol. Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, trustworthiness, and immutability, which can be used to solve the above problems. Although virtual marketing technology shows great potential, as a form of organization that is difficult to manage, there is still a lack of experience in the form factors and operation mechanism of a virtual business model. Therefore, combined with the realistic background, this paper built a digital twin innovation and entrepreneurship virtual marketing interactive platform based on blockchain. The article analyzed the data structure of the blockchain and completed the construction of the platform operation mode. It studied the encryption and decryption process of cryptography and expanded the ciphertext space, then the blockchain is encrypted and decrypted again, and finally, a chi-square analysis is performed. After building the platform, it conducted market research and analyzed the main operating indicators of the A platform on the market. Then, it compared the uncertain string preprocessing enumeration length change and the index occupied space between the platform constructed in this paper and the platform in the literature. The comparison results have shown that the index proposed in this paper is 320 MB in 8 iterative calculations, while the bibliographic index starts at 10000 MB and keeps increasing during the iterative calculation process.

AB  - In recent years, with the popularization of computer and information network technology, the core business of more and more industries has basically realized informatization office. Although the informatization office has brought a lot of convenience to people, the increasingly complex informatization infrastructure equipment has also buried many hidden dangers for people. More and more security incidents are caused by unfamiliarity with these infrastructures. How to use the information infrastructure correctly has become a problem considered by more and more enterprise information security departments, and the position of IT operation and maintenance is born to solve this hidden danger. The IT (Internet Technology) operation and maintenance personnel of each enterprise formulate a set of operational risk quantitative assessment models for the enterprise based on the internal information infrastructure equipment of the enterprise so that the enterprise staff can use these infrastructure equipment efficiently and safely. This paper focused on the quantitative assessment model of IT operation and maintenance operation risk constructed by the digital twin model. The quantitative assessment model of IT operation and maintenance operation risk constructed by the digital twin model was compared with the quantitative assessment model of IT operation and maintenance operation risk constructed by other traditional models. The comparison results showed that the output results of the evaluation model constructed by the digital twin model were closer to the actual results, and the accuracy rate was 35.9% higher than that of the previous operational risk assessment model.

TI  - Application of digital twin combined with artificial intelligence and 5G technology in the art design of digital museums
AU  - Zhao, Jing

AB  - More and more museums are being established or restored as people’s cultural levels grow. A digital twin is a computerized representation of the physical object or phenomenon, which acts as its real-time digital equivalent. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly widespread, and museums and art shows will need to change their old working and thinking processes to fully fulfill their potential. In an increasingly digital world, combining AI technologies and wearable devices into digital museums could assist in boosting involvement. It is necessary to investigate AI’s strategic function and application in affecting tourist experiences at art galleries and museums, as well as its potential to improve education. Also, digital twin (DT) paves the way to alleviate difficulties or might improve access to digital museums via digital experiences. The historical report recommends that digital museum items be represented in a way that poses the fewest threats to its legitimacy. Owing to its uniqueness and vulnerability to substantial environmental dangers, the safeguarding of art and cultural heritage in digital museums is a serious issue. There are many approaches for assessing the state of artistic heritage and protecting it from extreme acts. The current study offers a framework for digitized museum art design based on the utilization of digital twin (DT), artificial intelligence (AI), and fifth-generation (5G) technologies. Further to enhance the security of the system, we employ the improved blowfish encryption algorithm (IBEA). Also, the authentication is done using the Diffie-Hellman protocol. The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB, and its performance is analyzed and compared with conventional systems. From the result obtained, it was revealed that the suggested methodology express high range of security level (95%) than the existing mechanisms. This study is very important in two directions: (1) it presents an analytical structure for having to adapt digital information to complicated systems in museums and (2) it explains the artistic obstacles for heritage properties, such as accessibility, execution time, security level, and the efficiency of 3-dimensional designs.

AB  - With its advantages of low latency and global coverage, the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations can form an effective complement to the terrestrial 5G/6G mobile communication system and provide infrastructure support for broadband access and various services of the Internet. However, due to the spatial particularity of this network across land, sea, air, and other levels, it faces the dilemma of being "easy to attack" and "difficult to defend". At the same time, with the acceleration of the wave of digital transformation, the space Internet is increasingly facing software supply chain security risks. Currently, there is no security simulation and verification platform for the whole life cycle of the space Internet. Therefore, in the present study, we design a digital twin-based hyper large scientific infrastructure for the space Internet named Space Spider to realize the ground simulation of all elements of the space Internet and establish an attack and defense environment for the space Internet to support core technology verification. In addition, we also proposed Spiderland, an open experimental platform for space Internet applications and security researchers, to conduct simulation and attack-defense experiments.

T2  - IEEE Internet of Things Journal
AB  - Emerging digital twin (DT) and mobile-edge computing (MEC) are crucial for enabling the rapid development of 6G. However, the existing works ignore the edge collaboration, which can provide the system with additional performance gain. In this article, we study the problem of mobile users (MUs) intelligently offloading tasks to cooperative mobile-edge servers (MESs) with the assistance of DT. Specifically, a DT-assisted task offloading scheme (DTTOS) that consists of the selection of MESs and intelligent task offloading is proposed. Channel state information (CSI) and blockchain are employed to implement the selection of MESs. Then, we present a solution to enable MU’s task offloading that is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) in an intelligent way. After this, a mathematical optimization model aiming at decreasing power and time overhead is formulated. In view of the complexity, it is decomposed into two suboptimization models and solved by the decision tree algorithm (DTA) and double deep- Q -learning (DDQN), respectively. Simulations are conducted to prove the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of data security assurance and network performance improvement.

AB  - Network slice security is the prerequisite for introducing network slicing to vertical industries. There is gap between slice security requirements and different security capabilities that need to be provisioned during the slice lifecycle. An intelligent 5G slice security capabilities provisioning method is urgently needed to help provision the most suitable security capabilities of one slice dynamically according to the network status and the security target. This paper proposes digital-twin-based basic security functions and an autonomous 5G slice security capabilities provisioning solution in order to achieve KPI-driven dynamic slice security provision.

AB  - The complexity of the number of stakeholders, information systems used, and port operations evoke new challenges to port security when it comes to the total knowledge and control of the overall operations of transport and parking of containerized freight, namely hazmat ones.The rising interest and the port authorities' awareness of the relevance of security concerns involved in this complex ecosystem has led to the search for new technological solutions that allow, in an integrated manner, the smart and automatic control of operations of transport and hazardous freight parking in all the areas of its jurisdiction, without third-party dependencies.Despite its importance and criticality, port authorities tend to have limited real-time knowledge of the location of hazmat containers, whether moving within the port (entering and leaving), or in its parking, having a direct impact on the port security.This article presents a Digital Twin platform for 3D and real-time georeferenced visualization of container parks and the location of hazardous containerized freight. This tool combines different modules that further allow to visualize information associated to a container, its movement, as well as its surrounding area, including a realistic and dynamic 3D representation of what is the area encircling the port.

AB  - Most intelligent systems focused on how to improve performance including accuracy, processing speed with a massive number of data sets and those performance-biased intelligent systems, Red AI systems, have been applied to digital twin in smart cities. On the other hand, it is highly reasonable to consider Green AI features covering environmental, economic, social costs for advanced digital twin services. In this letter, we propose eco-friendly low resource security surveillance toward Green AI-enabled digital twin service, which provides eco-friendly security by the active participation of low resource devices. And, we formally define a problem whose objective is to maximize the participation of low source or reusable devices such that reusable surveillance borders are created within security district. Also, a dense sub-district with low resource devices priority completion scheme is proposed to resolve the problem. Then, the devised method is performed by expanded simulations and the achieved result is evaluated with demonstrated discussions.

AB  - Digital Twins and the Internet of Things (IoT) are two of the most prominent recent concepts and technologies. The IoT supports many applications that merge the physical with the cyber world. This highlights the need for improved security. Here, we argue that digital twins can help in securing and strengthening the IoT by using them for interacting with the actual IoT devices. While most digital twins implementations are centralized, we propose to integrate Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and digital twins into the IoT to realize decentralized, secure, available, flexible, and auditable blockchain-based IoT services for IoT devices that follow the W3C Web of Things (WoT) standards. In this work, we present the design of SmartTwin, a blockchain-based digital twin framework for which we provide two different implementations using two different blockchains, we present the design trade-offs, and we discuss future research and development directions.

AU  - Okegbile, Samuel D.
AU  - Cai, Jun
AB  - The human digital twin (HDT) is a new paradigm that possesses the ability to revolutionize the current healthcare systems. With HDT, ensuring an efficient connectivity scheme between each human-virtual twin pair remains a significant problem. As the concept of HDT is new, conventional connectivity schemes cannot meet the unique requirements of HDT in terms of reliability, security and privacy. This paper thus proposes an edge-assisted connectivity scheme for HDT and adopts an integrated blockchain and federated learning techniques to ensure security and privacy. To minimize long-term average connectivity cost, we formulated the connectivity problem as a Markov decision process and adopted the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to learn the optimal connectivity policy in terms of connectivity cost. The obtained results were then compared with the conventional deep Q-network-based solution. The results show that the proposed DDPG-based connectivity solution is feasible to perform the connectivity process better by optimally allocating system resources, thus reducing the overall connectivity cost, while ensuring data security and privacy.

AB  - The rapid acceleration of digitalization has intensified the focus on the use of Digital Twin (DT) across industries. While the concept of DT is not new in itself, the large-scale adoption across the industries is still maturing. The number of DTs deployed will continue to increase significantly1 and will represent components, systems, interactions, people, and even business processes. This will drive the need to connect multiple DTs that can operate seamlessly across systems and business boundaries, forming a collaborative digital ecosystem. The term Composite Digital Twin (CDT) is used to represent this interconnection and integration of DTs. To implement a CDT, several challenges such as trust, interoperability, governance, ownership, security, and privacy need to be addressed. First, this study explores the requirements to create a CDT covering operational, management, and security standpoints. After analyzing CDT requirements, an architecture is proposed to encapsulate the core functional and security requirements to enable emerging collaborative digital ecosystems. The architecture emphasis is placed on security and trust among participants to ensure that developers, providers, and users can have confidence in the services these CDT provide.

AB  - The present work aims to improve the communication security of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) nodes in intelligent transportation through studying the safety of IoV in smart transportation based on Blockchain (BC). An IoV DTs model is built by combining big data with Digital Twins (DTs). Then, regarding the current IoV communication security issues, a secure communication architecture for the IoV system is proposed based on the immutable and trackable BC data. Besides, Wasserstein Distance Based Generative Adversarial Network (WaGAN) model constructs the IoV node risk forecast model. Because the WaGAN model calculates the loss function through Wasserstein distance, the learning rate of the model accelerates remarkably. After ten iterations, the loss rate of the WaGAN model is close to zero. Massive in-vehicle devices in IoV are connected simultaneously to the base station, causing network channel congestion. Therefore, a Group Authentication and Privacy-preserving (GAP) scheme is put forward. As users increase during authentication, the GAP scheme performs better than other authentication access schemes. In summary, the Intelligent Transportation System driven by DTs can promote intelligent transportation management. Besides, introducing BC into IoV can improve access control’s accuracy and response efficiency. The research reported here has significant value for improving the security of the information sharing of the IoV.

TI  - Cyber digital twin simulator for automatic gathering and prioritization of security controls’ requirements
AU  - Hadar, Ethan
AU  - Kravchenko, Dmitry
AU  - Basovskiy, Alexander
AB  - The scale and complexity of cyber threats in digital enterprises hamper operators' ability to gather, prioritize and rationalize which security controls requirements should be handled first to achieve rapid risk reduction. This paper presents a cyber digital twin, based on attack graph analytics, that automatically gathers and prioritizes security controls requirements at scale over active networks. The first-of-a-kind twin collects information about the computer network, associates it with attack tactics, measures the efficiency of implemented security controls requirements and automatically detects missing security controls. The twin also evaluates a cyber risk value using the attack graph and proposes prioritization of the detected requirements to rapidly reduce risk within existing system constraints. The cyber digital twin simulator offers several new risk reduction methods for automatically selecting security controls requirements. The necessary data for constructing a contextual cyber digital twin is defined, including the relationship between security controls and attack tactics. The paper illustrates the calculations used for ranking security controls' risk impact, the algorithm for security controls' requirements prioritization, and finally demonstrates successful results using a field experiment conducted via an active network.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles(AVs) have developed rapidly in recent years and derived many AV-related services. However, the stringent requirement of real-time sensing, computing, and communication may severely overload the AV, resulting in a poor passenger experience. In this work, we leverage the digital twin(DT) concept to help the information fusion and computing for AV, propose a vehicular digital twin(VDT) framework. Specifically, DT is maintained in the cloud and synchronized with its corresponding AV in real-time. AV uploads necessary information to the DT, and DT makes feedback through processing and analysis. The DT can also communicate with other DTs to obtain information. Due to the real-time information synchronization of AV and DT in an open communication environment, ensuring communication security and protect privacy is needed. To tackle those issues, we give a concrete authentication protocol for secure communication between AV and DT. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that our proposed protocol not only has less computation cost but also can satisfy the necessary security requirements.

AB  - The digital twin is a rather new industrial control and automation systems concept. While the approach so far has gained interest mainly due to capabilities to make advanced simulations and optimizations, recently the possibilities for enhanced security have got attention within the research community. In this article, we discuss how a digital twin replication model and corresponding security architecture can be used to allow data sharing and control of security-critical processes. We identify design-driving security requirements for digital twin based data sharing and control. We show that the proposed state synchronization design meets the expected digital twin synchronization requirements and give a high-level design and evaluation of other security components of the architecture. We also make performance evaluations of a proof of concept for protected software upgrade using the proposed digital twin design. Our new security framework provides a foundation for future research work in this promising new area.

TI  - SPDT: Secure and privacy-preserving scheme for digital twin-based traffic control
AU  - Lai, Chengzhe

AB  - With the increasing complexity of the driving environment, more and more attention has been paid to the research on improving the intelligentization of traffic control. Among them, the digital twin-based internet of vehicle can establish a mirror system on the cloud to improve the efficiency of communication between vehicles, provide warning and safety instructions for drivers, avoid driving potential dangers. To ensure the security and effectiveness of data sharing in traffic control, this paper proposes a secure and privacy-preserving scheme for digital twin-based traffic control. Specifically, in the data uploading phase, we employ a group signature with a time-bound keys technique to realize data source authentication with efficient members revocation and privacy protection, which can ensure that data can be securely stored on cloud service providers after it synchronizes to its twin. In the data sharing stage, we employ the secure and efficient attribute-based access control technique to provide flexible and efficient data sharing, in which the parameters of a specific sub-policy can be stored during the first decryption and reused in subsequent data access containing the same sub-policy, thus reducing the computing complexity. Finally, we analyze the security and efficiency of the scheme theoretically.

AB  - The ANGEL Digital Twin for Cyber-Physical System Security is a novel approach for improving the security of critical and non-critical infrastructure. Digital Twin technology, widely used in the aviation, manufacturing and automotive industries, has the potential to improve the security and resiliency of the microgrid. In this paper, we present a framework for adapting the Digital Twin to the application of microgrid security. The Digital Twin is a real-time, physics-based simulation that runs alongside the physical system providing for its constant monitoring and control. The Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems, or ANGEL, will model both the cyber and physical layers of the microgrid and provide real-time data visualization. As a result, users will be aided in assessing the health of the physical plant and overall behavior over a range of operating conditions. The ANGEL Digital Twin will be able to use the real-time two-way coupling between the simulation and physical system to update and evolve the simulation to provide greater insight into the physical system. Ultimately ANGEL will provide the ability to diagnose and heal the physical system, mitigating both component failures and the effects of cyber attack. This paper will explain the methodology behind the design of this digital twin and the advantages of such an approach. To demonstrate the current capabilities of the ANGEL framework as a Level III digital twin, a simulation example is presented on the IEEE 39-bus benchmark.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing industry currently being integrated into both consumer and industrial environments on a wide scale. While the technology is available and deployment has a low barrier of entry in future applications, proper security frameworks are still at infancy stage and are being developed to fit varied implementations and device architectures. Further, the need for edge centric mechanisms are critical to offer security in real time smart connected applications with minimal or negligible overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of data security by using multiple device shadows (aka digital twins) for a single physical object. These twins are paramount to separate data among different virtual objects based on tags assigned on-the-fly, and are used to limit access to different data points by authorized users/applications only. The novelty of the proposed architecture resides in the attachment of dynamic tags to key-value pairs reported by physical devices in the system. We further examine the advantages of tagging data in a digital twin system, and the performance impacts of the proposed data separation scheme. The proposed solution is deployed at the edge, supporting low latency and real time security mechanisms with minimal overhead, and is light-weight as reflected by captured performance metrics.

AB  - Edge computing and digital twin technology are two new digital technologies that are developing rapidly. Edge computing has become more and more widely used in various scenarios and smart terminal devices, adding more and more edge computing business sinking demands, making the distance between computing and users and data smaller and smaller, and digital twin technology provides a method of model interpretation for complex physical entities, provides new ideas for physical information fusion, and makes it applicable to various scenarios of physical entities and the virtualization model can achieve deep coupling. Nowadays, society’s demand for power grids is getting higher and higher. Therefore, the security protection of power grids is an important issue worthy of in-depth consideration. After the introduction of edge computing and digital twins and technologies, the relative vulnerability of power grids has been further characterized. By analyzing the security risks and characteristics of edge computing, and based on the edge computing security protection architecture, a power grid digital twin security control model including the application layer, function layer, model layer, data layer, and physical layer is constructed, so as to ensure that all aspects of the power grid are controlled. Layers of protection of structures and units ensure that the power grid can still ensure efficient and safe operation in an environment blessed by new technologies.

AB  - Service providers, 5G network operators and, more generally, vertical industries face today a dangerous shortage of highly skilled cybersecurity experts. Along with the escalation and growing sophistication of cyber-attacks, 5G networks require the training of skilled and highly competent cyber forces. To meet these requirements, the SPIDER cyber range focuses specifically on 5G, and is based on three pillars, (i) cyber security assessment, (ii) training cyber security teams to defend against complex cyber-attack scenarios, and (iii) evaluation of cyber risk. The SPIDER cyber range replicates a customized 5G network, enabling the execution of cyber-exercises that take advantage of hands-on interaction in real time, the sharing of information between participants, and the gathering of feedback from network equipment, as well as the development and adaptation of advanced operational procedures. This aims to help 5G security professionals improve their ability to collaboratively manage and predict security incidents, complex attacks, and propagated vulnerabilities. The SPIDER cyber range is validated in two relevant use case scenarios aimed at demonstrating, in a realistic, measurable, and replicable way the transformations SPIDER will bring to the cybersecurity industry.

AU  - Shukla, Ankur
AB  - In recent years, the cybersecurity attacks on the internet of things (IoT)-based healthcare systems became the major concern for researchers and health organizations. With time, the sophistication of these attacks is increasing. Therefore, healthcare service providers must implement efficient security mechanisms carefully while taking the advantages of connected devices without compromising the patient safety and disturbing the real-time health services. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a real-time counterpart of a physical world. DT offers significant advantages to cybersecurity experts, empowering them to predict risks without entering the physical world, and to simulate and test cyber-attacks that would otherwise be infeasible to do in real-time in the physical environment. DT in healthcare helps to identify security vulnerabilities, conduct attack simulations, and potential security breaches by creating a virtual replica of the targeted healthcare systems. In this paper, a novel and automated conceptual framework is developed for reinforcing the cybersecurity in IoT-based healthcare using DT technology. It includes the conceptualization and analysis of the proposed framework which can provide dynamic and adaptive security solution to identify real-time threats and vulnerabilities in IoTbased healthcare applications.

AB  - Understanding cybersecurity threats, attacks, and incidents is crucial for organizations to perform preventive or re-active measures. Nevertheless, detailed Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is reluctantly shared. Digital twins, the virtual counterparts of real-world assets, offer security simulation capabilities. The simulation of attack scenarios on industrial control systems (ICS) with digital twins yields valuable threat information. In our work, we outline the systematic steps towards a structured threat report starting with digital twin security simulations: We first present the course of action and define formal requirements for framework deployment. We then conduct an attack simulation with a prototypical digital twin application to evaluate our frame-work. Using the STIX2.1 standard, we assist CTI generation by providing utility tools guiding through the process steps. Our experimental results show that a STIX2.1 CTI report can be systematically constructed with the opportunity to customize according to the use case at hand. Adding digital twin security simulations to the list of CTI sources can provide shareable CTI and help organizations improve their security posture.

AB  - The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.

AB  - The rapid growth and advancement of technology in industries provide a better quality of services to the end-user in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The digital twin (DT) is an innovative technology recently developed in Industry 4.0 to provide a virtual representation of physical components, products, or equipment such as computer numerical control (CNC) machines. It can be used to run simulations before manufacturing. However, traditional DT platforms lack data privacy, traceability, immutability, authentication of stakeholders. Moreover, manual prediction of the wearing of the tool condition of the CNC machine is challenging. Motivated from these gaps, in this paper, we propose a six-layered architecture for DT of CNC, which predicts CNC tool wear detection using a novel ensemble technique based soft voted prediction model consisting of XGBoost, random forest, and AdaBoost models. The proposed architecture also incorporates the public Ethereum blockchain (BC) to maintain the aforementioned issues of authentication, traceability, and transparency through constraints and automation programmed into the smart contracts (SC) developed. We evaluate the proposed scheme’s performance through simulation and compare it with other traditional approaches concerning several performance parameters (accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall). The result shows that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional approaches on these same performance parameters such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems
AB  - The purpose is to solve the security problems of the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (CITS) Digital Twins (DTs) in the Deep Learning (DL) environment. The DL algorithm is improved; the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is combined with Support Vector Regression (SVR); the DTs technology is introduced. Eventually, a CITS DTs model is constructed based on CNN-SVR, whose security performance and effect are analyzed through simulation experiments. Compared with other algorithms, the security prediction accuracy of the proposed algorithm reaches 90.43%. Besides, the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms regarding Precision, Recall, and F1. The data transmission performances of the proposed algorithm and other algorithms are compared. The proposed algorithm can ensure that emergency messages can be responded to in time, with a delay of less than 1.8s. Meanwhile, it can better adapt to the road environment, maintain high data transmission speed, and provide reasonable path planning for vehicles so that vehicles can reach their destinations faster. The impacts of different factors on the transportation network are analyzed further. Results suggest that under path guidance, as the Market Penetration Rate (MPR), Following Rate (FR), and Congestion Level (CL) increase, the guidance strategy’s effects become more apparent. When MPR ranges between 40%   80% and the congestion is level III, the ATT decreases the fastest, and the improvement effect of the guidance strategy is more apparent. The proposed DL algorithm model can lower the data transmission delay of the system, increase the prediction accuracy, and reasonably changes the paths to suppress the sprawl of traffic congestions, providing an experimental reference for developing and improving urban transportation.

TI  - A digital twins approach to smart grid security testing and standardization
AU  - Atalay, Manolya
AU  - Angin, Pelin
AB  - The exponential growth of the Internet of Things in recent years has created an ever larger cyber attack surface, introducing new security vulnerabilities for all computerized systems. Among the most significant of those systems are industrial control systems (ICS) consisting of many cyber physical components, and smart grids are a prominent example of ICS, whose failures have potential to cause major disruptions in all aspects of our daily lives. In this paper, we provide an overview of smart grid cybersecurity standards, and review major threats to smart grid environments at the physical, network and application layers. In order to overcome the current lack of standards for security evaluation of smart grids, we propose a digital twins based approach for the complete life cycle of a smart grid, which accurately models the functioning of the physical grid and avoids service disruptions caused by running security tests on the actual grid. A digital twins based approach is promising to provide a common ground for the development of standardized models for continuous and comprehensive penetration testing of smart grids.

AB  - Digital twin technology today is diverse and emerging and its full potential is not yet widely understood. The concept of a digital twin allows for the analysis, design, optimisation and evolution of systems to take place fully digital, or in conjunction with a cyber-physical system to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency when compared to traditional engineering approaches. Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms, such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems. The development of digital twin technology in traditional industries such as manufacturing, construction, the automotive industry, agriculture and transportation has highlighted its potential, but often insufficiently explored the risks associated with their integration. In this paper we explore risks relating to the cyber-security of systems employing digital twin technology and also consider the opportunities for digital twins themselves to mitigate cyber-security risks and become an integral part of a security in-depth defence.

AB  - This study aims to explore the security issues and computational intelligence of drone information system based on deep learning. Targeting at the security issues of the drone system when it is attacked, this study adopts the improved long short-term memory (LSTM) network to analyze the cyber physical system (CPS) data for prediction from the perspective of predicting the control signal data of the system before the attack occurs. At the same time, the differential privacy frequent subgraph (DPFS) is introduced to keep data privacy confidential, and the digital twins technology is used to map the operating environment of the drone in the physical space, and an attack prediction model for drone digital twins CPS is constructed based on differential privacy-improved LSTM. Finally, the tennessee eastman (TE) process is undertaken as a simulation platform to simulate the constructed model so as to verify its performance. In addition, the proposed model is compared with the Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and Attention-BiLSTM models proposed by other scholars. It was found that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed model is the smallest (0.20) when the number of hidden layer nodes is 26. Comparison with the actual flow value shows that the proposed algorithm is more accurate with better fitting. Therefore, the constructed drone attack prediction model can achieve higher prediction accuracy and obvious better robustness under the premise of ensuring errors, which can provide experimental basis for the later security and intelligent development of drone system.

AB  - A digital twin is a real-time representation of physical assets in a digital world. In future 6G networks, digital twin as the key technology will be widely used in intelligent manufacturing, smart city and scientific research etc., forwarding the whole society towards a "digital twin" world combining virtualization and reality. Just like the real network, the Digital Twin Network (DTN) will also face security risks and various attacks. In the DTN, the wrong instruction distribution from the twin network to physical network will directly affect the real world and cause chaos, so it is necessary to ensure the security of interaction interface. In this paper, we propose a security interaction engine named Digital Twin Protection Function (DTPF) to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, stability and non-reputation of messages during DTN policy distribution, which can provide a reference for securing the development of DTN.

AB  - Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that is a cornerstone of the 4th industrial revolution. Over the next decade, it is expected to revolutionise industrial processes via Internet of Things (IoT) and other enabling technologies such as 5G for better performance and safety. DT as a real time virtual representation of any physical system is envisaged to ensure better connectivity of industrial processes, increased speed of decision making and effective prediction that could lead to optimised performance enhancement at various levels in the business chain. However, unsecured, or poorly secured DTs can cause serious harm to an enterprise in key industrial sectors such as manufacturing and oil and gas which are of utmost importance to the world’s economy. The focus of this paper, therefore, is to identify security vulnerabilities of DTs in applied to the oil and gas industry and analyse effective security frameworks for monitoring oil and gas pipeline data and its transmission over various networks including through the Cloud. This is to prevent man-in-the-middle-attacks and reduce economic losses that can result. Furthermore, important considerations on the data attributes will be explored. These include accuracy of the data transmitted under various security implementation regimes, its completeness, and transmission delay of the various frameworks.

AB  - Increased outsourcing of Integrated Circuit (IC) design and fabrication combined with malicious hardware security threats such as contactless optical probing have greatly decreased an attacker’s difficulty in reverse engineering or maliciously modifying a given circuit. This has become a significant concern for the safety and security of the semiconductor industry. Physical inspection techniques have been used to validate the IC hardware integrity and detect security threats to address these concerns. However, most physical inspection methods for ICs rely upon removing unwanted epoxy packaging material without damaging the device under test (DUT). Therefore, the precise removal of the IC packaging guided by knowledge of the packaging structure is very important for efficiency and accuracy in this process. Currently, IC structure analysis depends on using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), which is time-consuming and lacks the spatial resolution necessary for characterizing advanced heterogeneous packages. For hardware assurance purposes, the entire volume of a device must be analyzed with high efficacy. Additionally, various packaging and the recently adopted 2.5D and 3D advanced packages bring more challenges to meet assurance requirements. Hybrid metrology, which is the combined use of inspection methods for characterization, has the potential to address the inspection challenges for advanced packaging. In this paper, a novel hybridized inspection method utilizing nondestructive THz time-domain spectrum (THz-TDS) and X-ray CT of the IC package is used to create a digital twin (DT) of the sample. The combined characterization can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and accuracy for high quality sample preparation. Hybrid inspection paired with automated sample preparation can reduce the time and operator input needed for complete verification of a large volume of samples. In this paper, the method of generating a digital twin of the IC internal regions of interest (ROI) will be introduced. Analysis of the generated digital twin is used to optimize the material removal necessary for IC verification without damaging the ROI. This inspection and removal methodology can be automated using boundary conditions from the design information of the IC package. Hybrid inspection provides the high spatial resolution thickness and geometry information for generating an automated material removal routine. This provides access to the sample’s ROI for further FIB plasma delayering and SEM verification.

AB  - The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications that need to cooperate unattended highlights the need for seamless interoperability and intrinsic security. We argue that Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), due to their decentralized nature, transparent operations, immutability, and availability, can enhance the security, reliability, and interoperability of such IoT systems. In this paper, we advance the integration of W3C's Web of Things (WoT) standards with DLTs and smart contracts, introducing smart contracts as “Digital Twins” of (physical) devices, or whole Cyber-Physical subsystems. Namely, we introduce a DLT-based architecture for controlling devices across federated IoT systems, securely, reliably, and with full auditability. The proposed architecture provides mass actuation and service composition with notable security properties, such as full auditability, transparency, and high availability. Specifically, a single request, with multiple action parameters and conditions, can trigger the reliable and secure actuation of a large number of possibly physically dispersed actuators.

AB  - Configuring intelligent manufacturing systems (IMSs) is significant for manufacturing enterprises to take a step toward Industry 4.0. However, most current IMS is configured based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with a centralized architecture, which results in poor flexibility to handle manufacturing disturbances and limits capacity to support security solutions. To solve the above issues, this article combines IIoT with the permissioned blockchain and proposes a novel manufacturing blockchain of things (MBCoT) architecture for the configuration of a secure, traceable, and decentralized IMS. Then, hardware infrastructures and software-defined components of MBCoT are designed to provide an insight into the industrial implementation of IMS. Furthermore, the consensus-oriented transaction logic of MBCoT is presented based on a crash fault-tolerant protocol, which empowers MBCoT with a strong but resource-efficient encryption mechanism to support the autonomous manufacturing process. Finally, the implementation of an MBCoT prototype system and its application examples justify that the proposed approach is practical and sound. The evaluation experiment demonstrates that MBCoT equips IMS with a secure, traceable, stable, and decentralized operating environment while achieving competitive throughput and latency performance.

AB  - As the growing proportion of aging population, the demand for sustainable, high quality, and timely healthcare services has become increasingly pressing, especially since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in the early of 2020. To meet this demand, a promising strategy is to introduce cloud computing and digital twin techniques into the healthcare systems, where the cloud server is employed for storing healthcare data and offering efficient query services, and the digital twin is used for building digital representation for patients and leverages the query services of the cloud server to monitor healthcare states of patients. Although several cloud computing and digital twin based healthcare monitoring frameworks have been proposed, none of them has considered the data privacy issue, yet the leakage of the private healthcare information may cause catastrophic losses to patients. Aiming at the challenge, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving similarity query based healthcare monitoring scheme over digital twin cloud platform, named PSim-DTH. Specifically, we first formalize a similarity query based healthcare monitoring model over digital twin cloud platform. Then, we deploy a partition-based tree (PB-tree) to index the healthcare data and introduce matrix encryption to propose a privacy-preserving PB-tree based similarity range query (PSRQ) algorithm. Based on PSRQ algorithm, we propose our PSim-DTH scheme. Both security analysis and performance evaluation are extensively conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposed PSim-DTH scheme is really privacy-preserving and efficient.

AB  - Digital twin technology is recently in the spotlight because of its potential applicability in business and industry. In digital twin environments, data generated from physical assets are transmitted to a remote server, which performs simulations through digital twins in a virtual space. Then, the simulation results can be shared with the data owner or other users. However, several challenges exist in the application of digital twin technology in the real world. One of the main challenges involves determining how to share real-time data for the simulation and how to share the simulation data securely. The data generated from physical assets may include sensitive information from data owners, and the leakage of data to an adversary can cause serious privacy problems. Moreover, the sharing of data with other data users should also be considered to maximize the availability of digital twin data. To resolve these issues, we propose a system model for the secure sharing of digital twin data. The proposed system model uses cloud computing for efficient data sharing and blockchain for data verifiability. We also propose communication schemes for the proposed model to guarantee privacy preservation and data security in wireless channels. We analyze the security of the proposed protocol using informal methods and formal methods such as BAN logic and the AVISPA simulation tool. Furthermore, we compare the proposed protocol with related protocols and demonstrate that the proposed scheme is applicable to digital twin environments.

AB  - Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and next-generation communications are crucial for enabling rapid development and deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication efficiency and data security for IoT applications.

AB  - The 4th Industrial revolution is driven by increased connectivity, digitization, automation and autonomy of manufacturing assets, which trigger strong optimization perspectives, new businesses as well as a handful of new threats which need to be properly addressed. The CyberFactory#1 project (ITEA nr 17032) aims at solving this dilemma between productivity and security through the design, development and demonstration of a System of Systems that embraces the technical, economical, human and the societal dimensions of future factories. It relies on innovative simulation, optimization and resilience capabilities. Pilots from transportation, automotive, electronics and machine manufacturing will host demonstrations of these achievements in a real operational environment at the end of a 3 years collaborative project. An approach based on digital twins' integration with cyber-range will be implemented, to analyze the impact of attacks in the quality monitoring of avionics electronic, to manufacturing cobotic systems in a virtual environment to improve their ability to withstand manipulation attempts, and as a tool for iterative design of safety/security functions for cobots.

AB  - Future wireless services will focus on improving the quality of life by enabling various applications, such as extended reality, brain-computer interaction, and healthcare. These applications will have diverse performance requirements (e.g., user-defined quality of experience metrics, latency, and reliability) which will be challenging to be fulfilled by existing wireless systems. To meet the diverse requirements of the emerging applications, the concept of digital twins has been recently proposed. A digital twin uses a virtual representation along with security-related technologies (e.g., blockchain), communication technologies (e.g., 6G), computing technologies (e.g., edge computing), and machine learning, so as to enable the smart applications. In this tutorial, we present a comprehensive overview on digital twins for wireless systems. First, we present the fundamental concepts (i.e., design aspects, high-level architecture, and frameworks) of digital twins for wireless systems. Second, a comprehensive taxonomy is devised for two aspects, namely, twins for wireless and wireless for twins. For the twins for wireless aspect, we consider issues related to design of twin objects, physical devices, and interface, as well as prototyping, deployment trends, incentive mechanism, isolation of twins, and decoupling. For the wireless for twins aspect, we consider issues related to accessing twin objects, security and privacy, and air interface design are considered. Finally, open research challenges and opportunities are discussed.

TI  - Digital twin for self-security of smart inverters
AU  - Hossen, Tareq
AU  - Gursoy, Mehmetcan
AU  - Mirafzal, Behrooz
AB  - Smart inverters connected to a communication network are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, a self-security approach is implemented using the digital twin concept for smart inverters. The digital twin is formed using the inverter’s normal operating region and the inverter’s dynamic model. Then, the incoming setpoints are autonomously examined using the digital twin, and only the safe setpoints are engaged to the inverter’s local controller. This paper demonstrates how the inverter’s normal operating region and dynamic model are formed. In particular, the normal operation region is experimentally verified by changing the P and Q setpoints engaged to the local controller, using a laboratory setup including a three-phase 1.5-kVA SiC-MOSFET inverter and a 12-kW NHR 9410 regenerative power grid emulator. The results demonstrate that the self-security technique can potentially protect inverters from man-in-the-middle attacks by examining the incoming commands (new setpoints) using the inverter’s digital twin before engaging the setpoints to the local controller.

AB  - While the number of digital services is increasing faster and faster, those services rely more and more on IoT systems to collect data and perform data analysis, eventually using AI techniques. In this context, devices are part of the “root of trust” and need to be secured in order to ensure high quality and trusted digital services. This paper presents an approach to facilitate the integration, verification and then the functional validation of the security into devices based on modeling and simulation. This approach allows reducing the cost impact of adding security layer to physical devices.

AB  - Cybersecurity testing of automotive systems has become a practical necessity, with the wide adoption of advanced driving assistance functions and vehicular communications. These functionalities require the integration of information and communication technologies that not only allow for a plethora of on-the-fly configuration abilities, but also provide a huge surface for attacks. Theses circumstances have also been recognized by standardization and regulation bodies, making the need for not only proper cybersecurity engineering but also proving the effectiveness of security measures by verification and validation through testing also a formal necessity. In order to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular systems, novel approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a methodology to create and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in a black box setting by using pattern matching-based binary analysis and translation mechanisms to formal attack descriptions as well as model-checking techniques. The approach is intended to generate meaningful attack vectors on a system with next-to-zero a priori knowledge.

AB  - With the rapid development of intelligent devices in wireless communication, the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks have limited high data rates, low latency, high avail-ability demands. The sixth-generation (6G) mobile network can use Digital-twin (DT) techniques to meet these demands. DT is the virtual representation of physical aspects such as 6G edge nodes. DT optimize the 6G edge nodes parameters using artificial intelligence (AI) and especially machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, AI and ML bring along privacy and security concerns. Therefore, user data must be protected from unauthorized persons during the 6G edge network recovery and expansion phases. In this paper, we proposed a new reliable Digital Twin-based 6G edge network recovery framework using Blockchain technology. We applied the Transfer Learning (TL) technique to improve our proposed framework’s performance. We ensured data privacy and security using TL and Blockchain.

AU  - Wu, Jingyi

AB  - The goal is to explore the prediction performance of energy consumption in digital twins of the intelligent factory in the process of urbanization, so that it can provide good guidance for the green development of cities. The digital twin technology is introduced into the intelligent factory, in view of the influence of life cycle, data transmission delay and other factors of the equipment on product energy consumption of intelligent factory manufacturing in the real physical environment. Meanwhile, it is improved by DL (deep learning) algorithm to construct an improved AlexNet algorithm framework. Then, DPFS (Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph) algorithm is adopted to build a digital twin energy consumption prediction model of intelligent factory based on DL and privacy algorithm. Finally, a simulation scenario is established to verify its performance. Through the comparative analysis of the digital twin energy consumption prediction model and other scholars’ models in related fields, the feature recognition accuracy of the constructed model reaches 89.23%, at least 1.95% higher than that of other neural network models. From the perspective of energy consumption data transmission performance, the data message delivery rate of the proposed model is not less than 80%. Besides, the data message leakage rate and packet loss rate are less than 11%, and the average delay is basically stable. Therefore, the constructed model can achieve high energy consumption data transmission security performance under the premise of ensuring the prediction accuracy, which can provide experimental basis for the prediction of energy consumption and the improvement of security maintenance performance in intelligent factories.

AB  - Rapid advancements in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) capabilities have motivated farmers to deploy this ecosystem on their farms. However, there is a growing concern among users regarding the security risks associated with CPS. Especially with rising number of cyber-attacks on CPS, such as modifying sensor readings, interrupting operations, etc. Therefore, this paper describes a security surveillance framework to detect deviations in the ecosystem by incorporating a digital twin supported anomaly detection model. The reason for incorporating digital twins is that they add value by enabling real-time monitoring of connected smart farms. We pre-process the collected data from sensors deployed on the smart farm setup. The pre-processed data is fused with our smart farm ontology to populate a knowledge graph. The generated graph is further queried to extract the necessary sensor data. We utilize the extracted normal data to train the anomaly detection model. Further, we tested our model if it identifies abnormal values from sensors by simulating anomalous use case scenarios specific to our ecosystem.

TI  - A service-oriented digital twins framework for smart grid management
AU  - Atalay, Manolya
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are infrastructures with capabilities of perception, networking, and computation. They consist of physical and virtual components that interact with their environment. Their main goal is to monitor the physical system in real-time to have its behavior under control. Some of these infrastructures require well-defined security measures due to their critical processing capabilities. Digital Twins are defined as virtual structures emulating the physical components in various systems. They enable the deployment of isolated simulation environments to test changes and specify the security issues of a CPS. One of the main applications of CPS is smart grids. Microservices allow us to create fine-grained operations on automation systems. Using small, well-defined, modular processes, we can observe the states of smart grid infrastructure in many stages. In this work, we aim to design a framework that can create a reliable environment for smart grids compliant with existing industrial standards. We propose a service-oriented digital twins framework consisting of entities such as power meters, data aggregators, and system parameters for providing a scalable and highly available platform for complex energy systems.

AB  - Eclipse Arrowhead is an open-source framework for industrial automation based on service-oriented principles. It allows the creation of a highly flexible System of Systems (SoS) by defining local clouds for connecting application systems running on industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs). However, in an ICPS context, resource constraints and battery-powered devices are facing issues such as high energy consumption, poor service availability, and low-security capabilities. The concept of Digital Twins (DTs) as a proxy (DTaaP) has been defined to address these CPS challenges by providing valuable properties such as energy efficiency, availability, and security. In this paper, we propose a solution to empower the Eclipse Arrowhead Framework (EAF) with DTaaP. Specifically, the proposed solution introduces AHDitto, an Arrowhead-compliant supporting core system, enabling EAF to achieve three DTaaP properties by integrating Eclipse Ditto with EAF.

AB  - Digital twins have recently gained significant interest in simulation, optimization, and predictive maintenance of Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Recent studies discuss the possibility of using digital twins for intrusion detection in industrial systems. Accordingly, this study contributes to a digital twin-based security framework for industrial control systems, extending its capabilities for simulation of attacks and defense mechanisms. Four types of process-aware attack scenarios are implemented on a standalone open-source digital twin of an industrial filling plant: command injection, network Denial of Service (DoS), calculated measurement modification, and naive measurement modification. A stacked ensemble classifier is proposed as the real-time intrusion detection, based on the offline evaluation of eight supervised machine learning algorithms. The designed stacked model outperforms previous methods in terms of F1Score and accuracy, by combining the predictions of various algorithms, while it can detect and classify intrusions in near real-time (0.1 seconds). This study also discusses the practicality and benefits of the proposed digital twin-based security framework.

AB  - Modern Residential Energy Storage Systems (RESSs) are monitored and controlled using Cloud based Energy Management System (CEMS). Analyzing the cyber-security of such RESSs controlled by CEMS is critical for developing appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems against cyber attacks targeting such RESSs. However, it is impractical and expensive to modify, scale and replicate the physical RESS as per the cyber-security study requirements. This paper presents, a lowcost Real-Time Digital Twin (RTDT) of an interconnected and distributed RESSs controlled and monitored via CEMS. Systematic procedure for the development of RTDT of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is described in detail. The proposed RTDT of a physical RESS test-bed gives flexibility to modify, scale and replicate the system without compromising its real-time fidelity. The development procedure can be easily replicated to develop RTDT of any CPS or micro-grid test-beds. To minimize RTDT development cost, single board computer with Simulink Desktop Real-Time is used instead of using expensive real-time simulators. The CEMS graphical user interface of the RTDT gives flexibility to control interconnected RESSs via the internet cloud. An experimental case study is presented to verify the performance of the RTDT. The RTDT is developed for a commercially available RESS and CEMS, and not for a theoretical system.

T2  - IEEE access : practical innovations, open solutions
AB  - The concept of digital twin (DT) has emerged to enable the benefits of future paradigms such as the industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0. The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and similar concepts.

AB  - With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O&G) industry is now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity, efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the O&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O&G industry is still at an early stage.

AB  - The rapid advancements in computing, storage, communications, and networking technologies have enabled the creation of Digital Twins (DTs). A DT is a digital representation of a real-world physical component, product, or equipment. A DT can be used for 3-D design, testing, simulation, and prototyping prior to the manufacturing of the physical component. Once a physical component is in operation, a DT can be used for configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. It is expected that DTs will gain significant attention in the foreseeable future, and will play a key role in Industry 4.0. However, today's approaches, systems, and technologies leveraged for the creation of DTs are mostly centralized and fall short of providing trusted data provenance, audit, and traceability. Also, data related to transactions, logs, and history are not secure or tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based creation process of DTs to guarantee secure and trusted traceability, accessibility, and immutability of transactions, logs, and data provenance. Our proposed approach uses smart contracts to govern and track transactions initiated by participants involved in the creation of DTs. Our approach also employs decentralized storage of interplanetary file systems to store and share DTs data. Moreover, we present details on our system design and architecture, implementation, and algorithms. Furthermore, we provide security and cost analysis, and show how our approach fulfills the requirements of DTs process creation. We make the smart contract code for creating DTs publicly available on Github.

AB  - Following the fourth industrial revolution, and with the recent advances in information and communication technologies, the digital twinning concept is attracting the attention of both academia and industry worldwide. A microgrid digital twin (MGDT) refers to the digital representation of a microgrid (MG), which mirrors the behavior of its physical counterpart by using high-fidelity models and simulation platforms as well as real-time bi-directional data exchange with the real twin. With the massive deployment of sensor networks and IoT technologies in MGs, a huge volume of data is continuously generated, which contains valuable information to enhance the performance of MGs. MGDTs provide a powerful tool to manage the huge historical data and real-time data stream in an efficient and secure manner and support MGs’ operation by assisting in their design, operation management, and maintenance. In this paper, the concept of the digital twin (DT) and its key characteristics are introduced. Moreover, a workflow for establishing MGDTs is presented. The goal is to explore different applications of DTs in MGs, namely in design, control, operator training, forecasting, fault diagnosis, expansion planning, and policy-making. Besides, an up-to-date overview of studies that applied the DT concept to power systems and specifically MGs is provided. Considering the significance of situational awareness, security, and resilient operation for MGs, their potential enhancement in light of digital twinning is thoroughly analyzed and a conceptual model for resilient operation management of MGs is presented. Finally, future trends in MGDTs are discussed.

AB  - Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that replicates any physical phenomenon from a physical space to a digital space in congruence with the physical state. However, devising a Healthcare DT model for patient care is seen as a challenging task as the lack of adequate data collection structure. There are also security and privacy concerns as healthcare data is very sensitive and can be used in malicious ways. Because of these current research gaps, the proper way of acquiring the structured data and managing them in a secure way is very important. In this article, we present a mathematical data model to accumulate the patient relevant data in a structured and predefined way with proper delineation. Additionally, the provided data model is described in harmony with real life contexts. Then, we have used the patient centric mathematical data model to formally define the semantic and scope of our proposed Healthcare Digital Twin (HDT) system based on Blockchain. Accordingly, the proposed system is described with all the key components as well as with detailed protocol flows and an analysis of its different aspects. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed model with a critical comparison with other relevant research works have been provided.

AB  - The next generation (6G) wireless systems aim to cater to the Internet of Everything (IoE) and revolutionize customer services and applications to a fully intelligent and autonomous system. To achieve this, the digital twin edge network (DITEN) is proposed to combine mobile/multi-access edge computing (MEC) and digital twin (DT), thereby improving the network performance such as throughput and security, and reducing the cost of communication, computation, and caching. In DITENs, the network status can be continuously monitored, and based on the obtained network states, the networking schemes, such as routing and resource management, can be studied in the established DITENs from a centralized perspective. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of DITEN for 6G. First, we present the fundamental aspects of DITEN, including concept, framework, and potential. Second, a comprehensive design of DITEN is devised, including the DT modeling/updating, DT deployment, key issues, and enabling technologies. Then, the typical applications of DITEN towards 6G are provided, including the Internet of Things (IoT), vehicular network, space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), healthcare, wireless systems, and other applications, along with the design of DITEN in each application, such as DT modeling, DT association, incentive mechanisms, and so on. Finally, challenges and open issues are discussed.

T2  - IEEE access : practical innovations, open solutions
AB  - Modern power systems have been expanding significantly including the integration of high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, bringing a tremendous computational challenge to transient stability simulation for dynamic security assessment (DSA). In this work, a practical method for energy control center with the machine learning (ML) based synchronous generator model (SGM) and dynamic equivalent model (DEM) is proposed to reduce the computational burden of the traditional transient stability (TS) simulation. The proposed ML-based models are deployed on the field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for faster-than-real-time (FTRT) digital twin hardware emulation of the real power system. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithm is adopted to train the SGM and DEM, where the training and testing datasets are obtained from the off-line simulation tool DSAToolsTM/TSAT®. A test system containing 15 ACTIVSg 500-bus systems interconnected by a 15-terminal DC grid is established for validating the accuracy of the proposed FTRT digital twin emulation platform. Due to the complexity of emulating large-scale AC-DC grid, multiple FPGA boards are applied, and a proper interface strategy is also proposed for data synchronization. As a result, the efficacy of the hardware emulation is demonstrated by two case studies, where an FTRT ratio of more than 684 is achieved by applying the GRU-SGM, while it reaches over 208 times for hybrid computational-ML based digital twin of AC-DC grid.

AB  - The Digital Twin concept promises numerous applications across industries and its physical twin’s entire life cycle. Although numerous architectures have been proposed to develop and describe the setup of Digital Twin applications, current Digital Twin architectures do not address the versatile cross-industry character of the Digital Twin concept, its safety, security, and privacy aspects, and are often use case-specific and inflexible. We propose a three-dimensional Digital Twin reference architecture model for application across industries, considering functionality, dependability, and life cycle aspects. Our model provides practitioners a common platform to develop and discuss Digital Twin applications of different complexities and dependability aspects along varying life cycles and independent of the industry. Its applicability is validated and showcased by examples from the fields of mechatronic products, healthcare, construction, transportation, astronautics, and the energy sector. We compare our reference architecture model to existing architectures, discuss its advantages and limitations, and position the model within previous literature.

AB  - Emerging technologies, such as digital twins and 6th generation (6G) mobile networks, have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy, federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks. However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge association by jointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem. Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark learning methods.

This paper provides an IoT-based digital twin (DT) of the cyber-physical system that interacts with the control system to ensure its proper operation. The IoT cloud provision of the energy cyber-physical and the DT are mathematically formulated. Unlike other cybersecurity frameworks in the literature, the proposed one can mitigate an individual as well as coordinated attacks. The framework is tested on a distributed control system and the security measures are implemented using cloud computing. The physical controllers are implemented using single-board computers. The practical results show that the proposed DT is able to mitigate the coordinated false data injection and the denial of service cyber-attacks.

AB  - The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object, which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT.

We propose a federated learning-based DT framework and present a Secure and lAtency-aware dIgital twin assisted resource scheduliNg algoriThm (SAINT). SAINT achieves low-latency, accurate, and secure DT by jointly optimizing its total iteration delay and loss function, and leveraging abnormal model recognition (AMR). SAINT enables intelligent resource scheduling by using DT to improve the learning performance of deep Q-learning. SAINT supports access priority and energy consumption awareness due to the consideration of long-term constraints. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, SAINT has superior performance in cumulative iteration delay, DT loss function, energy consumption, and access priority deficit.

AB  - Nowadays, the growth of advanced technologies is paving the way for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and making them more efficient and smarter. However, this makes ICS more connected to communication networks that provide a potential platform for attackers to intrude into the systems and cause damage and catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose implementing digital twins that have been equipped with an intrusion detection algorithm. Our novel algorithm is able to detect attacks in a timely manner and also diagnose the type of attack by classification of different types of attacks. With digital twins, which are a new concept in ICS, we have virtual replicas of physical systems so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of the physical systems. So by placing the intrusion detection algorithm in digital twins, security tests can be done remotely without risking negative impacts on live systems.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets.

TI  - Smart grid anomaly detection using a deep learning digital twin
AU  - Danilczyk, William

AB  - The power grid is considered to be the most critical piece of infrastructure in the United States because each of the other fifteen critical infrastructures, as defined by the Cyberse-curity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), require the energy sector to properly function. Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.

AB  - Digital Twin (DT) has become the key technology in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in smart cities to keep the health and reliability of various DT requesters, such as private vehicles, public transportation, energy systems, etc. The combination of DT and ITS can further release the potential of participants in smart cities and guarantee their efficiency and reliability. Despite the advantages of DT-enabled ITS, not all requesters need the same level of DT service due to the highly dynamic nature of ITS. Safe and reliable matching between DT and ITS still needs to be resolved. To address these issues, we propose the blockchain-enabled Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) for ITS. First, we propose an on-demand DTaaS architecture to fully utilize the sensing capabilities of ITS and the macro perspective of DT. Second, a double-auction model and a price adjustment algorithm are proposed to realize the optimal DT matching for ITS requesters and ensure the benefits of participants. Third, a permissioned blockchain and a novel DT-DPoS consensus mechanism are established to enhance the security and efficiency of DTaaS. Simulation shows that the proposed DTaaS and double-auction can efficiently stimulate and facilitate DT transactions. The proposed DT-DPoS also has obvious advantages.

T2  - IEEE Internet of Things Journal
AB  - With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), the digital twin is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to connect physical components with digital space for better optimization of physical systems. However, the limited wireless resource and security concerns impede the deployment of the digital twin in IoT. In this article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in digital twin construction.

AB  - In the digital twin environment, the fusion data onto physical entities in the physical space are mapped to multiple virtual spaces for digital modeling and intelligent simulation in different dimensions. In real intelligent manufacturing scenarios, heterogeneous multi-source fusion data are collected at the same time period. So they are consistent in time state. For the autonomous digital twin system, time states verification and integrity checking are basic security factors. Provable data possession technology can check the integrity of data onto virtual spaces. The blockchain can provide the synchronization interface to make distributed entities to obtain the trusted time state value. Considering the privacy, the blockchain can also provide anonymous services for entities. Therefore, we propose the blockchain-based synchronized provable data possession scheme (named BSPDP) for digital twin. In our scheme, the selection of verifier is flexible. Since virtual spaces may be maliciously framed to pay compensation, we use tag verification to prevent honest virtual spaces from being framed. Under the assumption of RSA, the proposed BSPDP is provably secure. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that BSPDP is practical. The experimental results show that BSPDP is effective and attractive for digital twin.

AB  - Digital Twin is a term currently popular among researchers in the context of digitalization, Cyber-Physical Systems and Industry 4.0. Therefore, this paper gives a brief history of the Digital Twin concept and presents its main components as they have been introduced by two well known architectures. Different applications of Digital Twins in manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, and agriculture are shown. Their analysis emphasized that the implementation of the Digital Twin concept is still in its infancy and several key challenges must be considered. Among those, communications, big data analysis, and security have received the most attention from the research community and industry. Two different architectures, that use two different communication protocols to transmit the acquired data describing the physical system to be replicated in the digital world are given as use-case systems. These identify the Internet of Things vision as a key enabler of Digital Twin implementations.

AB  - To explore the airspace structure and safety performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system based on spatial digital twins (DTs), the study introduces DTs technology, and combines convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with UAV autonomous network. The DTs system of UAV is constructed by using wireless communication technology, and its security performance is simulated. The results show that in the analysis of the system packet loss rate, it is found that with the increase of the acquisition points, the amount of transmitted data only increases slightly, but the packet loss rate does not change significantly. In the analysis of the network performance of the unmanned aircraft system, it is found that the node energy-based weighted clustering algorithm (EWCA) can be used to increase the life of the overall network and enhance its availability by rationally controlling the number of nodes and the number of switching between clusters. As the number of nodes increases, the minimum survival time of each clustering algorithm decreases linearly. When the number of nodes is less than 600, the growth rate of cluster head is higher; When the number of nodes is more than 600, the curve growth is relatively smooth. In the analysis of the probability of network safety interruption, it is found that using the model constructed, when the energy acquisition coefficient is close to 0.5, the energy conversion efficiency is higher, the signal-to-noise ratio is larger. Also, when the number of intermediate nodes is increased to 10, the UAV has the best network safety performance. Therefore, through the research, it is found that the UAV DTs system constructed can significantly improve the safety performance of the UAV during its airspace flight. It can provide experimental references for the widespread application of the UAV in the later period.

AB  - Modern power system because of its high voltage, high power characteristics, makes the hardware experiment with certain safety risk and grid security risks. As a more complex simulation method, digital twins are more extensive in time scale compared with the traditional power system simulation, and more frequent in data interaction with the real system. Digital twins can be applied in power systems in a variety of ways. But at present, the application of digital twin still stays on the application of the whole product life cycle. This paper proposes a new real-time interactive power system simulation architecture based on the digital twin, and set up an electric power system based on SoC platform of digital twin, PL part has set up a twin body for the electric power system, the PS part compare the difference between the twin body and the actual body and then modify the twin body. It also provides the control part which is consistent with the hardware control logic. The platform is lightweight, economical, heterogeneous and compatible with a variety of computing tasks, rich interfaces and strong expansibility. This paper provides a framework for the application of digital twins in power system and provides the platform with rich application value.

AB  - The physical and virtual access of manufacturing equipment to the cloud platform is an important direction of cloud manufacturing research, but the current research results in this direction are not enough to support the "landing" and wide application of cloud manufacturing model. In the traditional cloud manufacturing model, the direct access of manufacturing equipment to the cloud brings huge network pressure and unbearable latency, and also poses a privacy and security risk. Aiming at the cloudification of manufacturing equipment in the cloud manufacturing environment, the 3D printer is selected as the research object, and a cloud-edge collaboration architecture for 3D printers based on digital twin is proposed. To solve the lack of network reliability brought about by traditional cloudification, time-sensitive services are deployed at the edge, realizing the local extension of cloud services. The digital twin information model of FDM additive manufacturing is defined. Real time controlling and monitoring based on digital twin is realized. By cloud-edge collaboration, an application case is implemented, which verifies the effectiveness of the system and provides a reference solution for the cloudification of other manufacturing equipment in the environment of cloud manufacturing.

However, this makes these systems more and more connected and part of a networked system. This can provide an entry point for attackers to infiltrate the system and cause damage with potentially catastrophic consequences. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a digital twin-based security framework for ICS that consists of two parts: attack detection and attack mitigation. In this framework we deploy an intrusion detection system in digital domain that can detect attacks in a timely manner. Then, using our mitigation method, we keep the system stable with acceptable performance during the attack. Additionally, we implement our framework on a real testbed and evaluate its capability by subjecting it to a set of attacks.

AB  - At present, the transition from the traditional scheme of energy supply organization to new technologies and practices, implying decentralization, digitalization and intellectualization systems of energy-saving with the active involvement of consumers in the generation and management of all types of energy resources, is becoming increasingly relevant. According to forecasts of experts given in the study “Distributed energy in Russia: potential for development”, the architecture of a distributed energy (DE) system being created will include the following elements: manageable interfaces, “routers of energy”, and platforms of management and services. Most of the platform solutions being created include only a part of the elements from the list above. Existing solutions in the field of DE are based on algorithms that do not provide the flexibility of decision-making and the proper level of security. The purpose of our work is to develop the concept of the intelligent management system of DE facilities. The principle of modular programming using the kernel expansion method was taken as a basis for the development of the concept. The proposed intelligent management system operates in real-time and allows implementing new algorithms and methods of control of the power system, including the management of its active elements. The subsequent development of the project includes the development of the architecture of the software platform and the implementation of the management system of DE facilities. Using the results of the work will increase the efficiency of management of DE facilities.

AU  - Madni, Carla C.
AB  - With increasing interconnectedness and complexity of aerospace systems and system-of-systems, it no longer suffices to perform experimentation and integration without an overarching framework to organize modeling, simulation, and analysis artifacts. With recent advances in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), several key building blocks for such a framework are already in place. However, important challenges remain. No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems
AB  - The purpose of this exploration of blockchain in vehicle management based on Digital Twins in Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) is to further improve intelligent transportation in smart cities. In view of the complexity of pedestrians in the real road network, the Digital Twins (DTs) technology is used to map the traffic situation in the real road network to the virtual space. Furthermore, the concrete interaction of vehicle data information is stored and transmitted by using blockchain technology. Finally, the DTs model of vehicle-mounted Ad Hoc network based on blockchain is constructed, and its performance is analyzed by simulation. The results suggest that the model algorithm adopted in this work shows a lower average delay time, its data message delivery rate is basically stable at 80%, the data message leakage rate is basically stable at approximately 10%, and the communication overhead does not exceed 700 bytes. Therefore, the in-vehicle self-organizing network model constructed in this work shows high network security performance while ensuring low latency performance, enabling information to interact more efficiently. Therefore, it can provide an experimental basis for the intelligent development and safety performance improvement of the transportation field of smart cities.

TI  - Creating a digital twin of an insider threat detection enterprise using model-based systems engineering
AU  - Lee, James
AU  - Alghamdi, Ahmad
AU  - Zaidi, Abbas K.
AB  - Inference Enterprise Modeling (IEM) is a methodology developed to address test and evaluation limitations that insider threat detection enterprises face due to a lack of ground truth and/or missing data. IEM uses a collection of statistical, data processing, analysis, and machine learning techniques to estimate and forecast the performance of these enterprises. As part of developing the IEM method, models satisfying various detection system evaluation requirements were created. In this work, we extend IEM as a digital twin generation technique by representing modeled processes as executable UML Activity Diagrams and tracing solution processes to problem requirements using ontologies. Using the proposed framework, we can rapidly prototype a digital twin of a detection system that can also be imported and executed in systems engineering simulation software tools such as Cameo Enterprise Architecture Simulation Toolkit. Cyber security and threat detection is a continuous process that requires regular maintenance and testing throughout its lifecycle, but there often exists access issues for sensitive and private data and proprietary detection model details to perform adequate test and evaluation activities in the live production environment. To solve this issue, organizations can use a digital twin technique to create a real-time virtual counterpart of the physical system. We describe a method for creating digital twins of live and/or hypothetical insider threat detection enterprises for the purpose of performing test and evaluation activities on continuous monitoring systems that are sensitive to disruptions. In this work, we use UML Activity Diagrams to leverage the integrated simulation capabilities of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE).

AB  - This paper presents the conceptualisation of a framework that combines digital twins with runtime verification and applies the techniques in the context of security monitoring and verification for satellites. We focus on special considerations needed for space missions and satellites, and we discuss how digital twins in such applications can be developed and how the states of the twins should be synchronised. In particular, we present state synchronisation methods to ensure secure and efficient long-distance communication between the satellite and its digital twin on the ground. Building on top of this, we develop a runtime verification engine for the digital twin that can verify properties in multiple temporal logic languages. We end the paper with our proposal to develop a fully verified satellite digital twin system as future work.

TI  - Data-driven digital twins in surgery utilizing augmented reality and machine learning
AU  - Riedel, Paul
AU  - Riesner, Michael
AU  - Wendt, Karsten
AU  - Aßmann, Uwe
AB  - On the one hand, laparoscopic surgery as medical state-of-the-art method is minimal invasive, and thus less stressful for patients. On the other hand, laparoscopy implies higher demands on physicians, such as mental load or preparation time, hence appropriate technical support is essential for quality and suc-cess. Medical Digital Twins provide an integrated and virtual representation of patients' and organs' data, and thus a generic concept to make complex information accessible by surgeons. In this way, minimal invasive surgery could be improved significantly, but requires also a much more complex software system to achieve the various resulting requirements. The biggest challenges for these systems are the safe and precise mapping of the digital twin to reality, i.e. dealing with deformations, movement and distortions, as well as balance out the competing requirement for intuitive and immersive user access and security. The case study ARAILIS is presented as a proof in concept for such a system and provides a starting point for further research. Based on the insights delivered by this prototype, a vision for future Medical Digital Twins in surgery is derived and discussed.

TI  - Using network simulators as digital twins of 5G/B5G mobile networks
AU  - Nardini, Giovanni
AU  - Stea, Giovanni
AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) have been proposed as digital replicas of physical entities (e.g., manufacturing plants), which one can observe and interact with, e.g., to perform what-if analysis. In this paper, we argue that mobile networks need DTs as well, and network simulators appear to be promising candidates to fulfill that role. We discuss the challenges that need be addressed to make this happen, e.g., centralized vs. distributed implementation, gathering input from the physical network, security issues and hosting, and the possibilities offered by network simulation in terms of what-if analysis, defining the concepts of lockstep and branching analysis. We exemplify the above concepts using Simu5G, a popular 5G/B5G simulation library for OMNeT++, as a reference case study.

AB  - Road and bridge management are not an easy affair; Therefore, smart way is needed to encourage easier, cost effective, and more efficient construction monitoring and maintenance processes. Currently, road and bridge management has utilized internet of things-based sensing technology and has produced a big data. However, the data is still in silos, so it needs to be arranged into one data. This one data becomes a digital representation or ‘digital twin’ of roads and bridges. The aim of this paper is to present the concept digital twin for road and bridge management especially for construction monitoring and maintenance. This paper also discusses open problem and issues related to implementation of digital twin in West Java Province-Indonesia as a piloting project. In this study, we designed a digital twin architecture for the six-step cycle of monitoring and maintenance of road and bridge construction in West Java which consists of a survey process, technical planning, budgeting, procurement, implementation and service and permission, then the data is integrated into ‘Smart X Platforms’. As a result, we have successfully integrated 15 types of data related to road and bridge management in West Java Province. We also found problems in implementing digital twins for the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges including map availability, license ownership, security system and smart contracts, and dashboard display speed.

TI  - Blockchain checksum for establishing secure communications for digital twin technology
AU  - Danilczyk, William
AU  - Sun, Yan Lindsay
AU  - He, Haibo
AB  - As Digital Twin technology continues to be developed for the power grid and other high value applications, the security and accuracy of the remote sensor data is of extreme importance. In this paper, we propose a novel implementation of the SHA-256 hash algorithm to create a blockchain of sensor readings. The implementation hashes the current sensor reading to the previous reading(s) from the sensor through a chained checksum SHA-256 algorithm. The enhanced chained-checksum is able to establish the trustworthiness of the communications between the control center and the remote sensor based on the length of the unbroken linked list. The chain of sensor readings act as a sophisticated checksum for the middleware communications used in the digital twin environment which often times are not secure. While the concept is based on blockchain technology, this implementation is specifically designed for two party communications, in this case the outstation and the control center. To accommodate the two party communications, the implementation allowed for the removal of some of the features commonly used in blockchain, such as consensus polling or the proof of work algorithm, and replaced them with historical values to establish the ground truth. To show the advantages of the chained checksum, the SHA-256 algorithm has been implemented in the IEEE 33-bus benchmark system in the Typhoon Hardware in the Loop (HIL) real-time simulator.

AB  - This paper proposes the parameter tuning methods for building the dynamic Digital Twin of generation unit in the power grid. Recently, the Digital Twin is paid more attention to its application in the digitalization of power grid, which could improve the accuracy for state monitoring, support the security assessment and operate the predictive simulation to assist the operator for the optimization of the power system. To achieve them, the investigation of the method for building the Digital Twin is essential. This paper provides four methods for dynamically parameterizing the Digital Twin to keep its adaptivity. The parameter tuning is the sine qua non to keep the Digital Twin alive with the dynamically regulating the parameters for the replication of the physical system feature. To investigate the efficiency for building the Digital Twin by these methods, the Cigré benchmark is utilized as the standard physical power grid. The fourth-order synchronous generator is applied for building the Digital Twin with the parameter estimation methods. The results of the parameter estimation show that two of them have high performance in estimating the parameters for Digital Twin.

AB  - In-depth analysis of medical data through machine learning to achieve disease prediction is beneficial to the early detection and treatment of diseases. However, medical data involves mass patient privacy, and datasets of different medical institutions cannot be directly shared due to privacy protection. So medical data often exists in the form of data islands, which makes it difficult for most existing prediction models to complete disease prediction. In this paper, a digital twin assisted efficient clustering Federated Learning (FL) algorithm for disease prediction is proposed. It can break data islands to predict diseases on the premise of privacy security. Firstly, we design an efficient clustering Federated Learning with Client Selection (FLCS) protocol based on heterogeneity and contribution to improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy. Secondly, we use digital twin to assist the FLCS protocol to carry out large-scale prediction. In addition, the shapley value introduced in the calculation of client contribution makes the model interpretable and enhances the reliability of prediction results. Finally, the evaluation results show that compared with the common prediction models and FedAvg algorithm, the FLCS protocol assisted by digital twin has better efficiency and accuracy in binary classification prediction.

TI  - Challenges in modelling applications for safe and resilient digital twins
AU  - Khan, Muhammad Taimoor
AB  - Digital twin-based modern smart city infrastructures are evolving into intelligent and distributed systems of autonomous entities operating in a dynamic cyber-physical environment to offer real-time and critical services. These services are typically implemented as software applications in various application domains, e.g., healthcare, cooperative robotic systems, and autonomous vehicles. However, to assure continued safe operations of the critical services with strict real-time requirements even when the service is under attack is an extremely challenging task mainly because the underlying operating environment for such applications is highly volatile yet distributed. To this end, first, we classify (as we call it) timed resilience requirements into computational and communication resilience and then discuss key challenges that hinder the modeling of such requirements to help develop rigorous distributed applications for real-time resilient autonomous systems. Finally, we demonstrate our vision to handle these challenges by introducing by-design and by-response approaches that consider security as a prerequisite of the safety and resilience of autonomous systems.

AB  - In this manuscript we describe the implementation of a digital twin for industrial networks. The aim is to provide a playground for cyber-security analysis and validation without the risk of interfering to any extent with the real cyber-physical system and its environment. The proposed implementation methodology provides a very high degree of automation, following the telecom-oriented NFV-MANO approach, and shows that different network topologies may be activated in a matter of just a few minutes. Each topology may then be used as a sort of cyber-range for the experimentation of possible attacks and validation of related countermeasures.

AB  - The growing popularity and features of digital twins have made them key elements in Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose the use of digital twins as an indirection mechanism, instead of accessing directly the actual IoT devices, in order to offer secure sensing and actuation in IoT systems through Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), which can enhance the security and transparency of such digital twins. In particular, we leverage advances in Web of Things (WoT) and permissioned blockchains to build flexible and secure digital twins. Specifically, we build smart contract-based digital twins of IoT devices that follow W3C's WoT standards. This architecture offers decentralization, immutability, auditability, and enhanced availability and reliability.

AB  - This paper presents a Digital Twin (DT)-based methodology for real-time assessment of microgrid resilience. Unlike conventional assessment methods, the proposed approach makes use of live system data via the DT of a microgrid; considers not only the steady-state power/energy balancing, but also the dynamic system security constraints under adverse operational conditions associated with line or generator outages. A real-time model based on the future anticipated microgrid at the University of Strathclyde campus has been developed in the RTDS simulator, and a prototype DT of the microgrid and the proposed DT-based resilience assessment have been implemented on a hardware platform, which is interfaced with the RTDS via communication links for realistic demonstration. Preliminary results are generated to illustrate the fundamental concepts of the approach, where N-1 tests and a large sample size are used to generate visualisations of system risk and impact of different events to identify high risk components and compute performance metrics e.g. loss of load probability. This work is intended to be continued on larger networks with more complex systems to demonstrate the value of fast-acting resilience quantification.

AB  - In recent years, the rapid development of a new generation of information technology has injected strong impetus into the landing of energy digital twin, and various energy digital twin bodies emerge endlessly. However, due to the lack of systematic evaluation theory and method guidance, it is difficult to analyze and quantify the quality, performance, applicability or symbiosis, adaptability and value of digital twin in energy field, which seriously hinders the in-depth promotion and application of digital twin in energy field. Therefore, based on the above considerations, this paper proposes a data-driven energy digital twin quality model, which reflects the quality characteristics of energy digital twin from nine aspects: functionality, performance efficiency, ease of use, instantaneity, reliability, information security, easy maintenance, integration and intelligence. At the same time, in view of the shortcomings of the theoretical verification of the current research, this paper selects the actual power transformer digital twin for experimental verification of the proposed index, and proves the rationality of the theory.

AB  - In the manufacturing domain, the digital twin has become an emerging concept for decision-making through the integration of what-if simulation capabilities. In such systems, the processing of the entire space of alternative solutions is very time-consuming; recommendation systems are used to solve this; however, these suffer from several problems, namely data sparsity and cold-start. The application of trust-based models can mitigate these problems, particularly the cold-start problems, by providing valuable background for the recommendation system. This paper presents the implementation and experimental validation of a trust-based model for improving the digital twin based what-if simulation recommendation system, addressing the cold-start problems. The proposed trust model was applied in an assembly line case study to recommend the best configurations for the optimal number of AGVs (Autonomous Guided Vehicles). The results show that applying the trust-based model with similarity metrics improved the mitigation of the cold-start problem. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This work aims to improve the communication security of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) based on digital twins (DTs). The related technologies of quantum communication are introduced to improve network communication. Firstly, the key DTs technologies in the construction of IIoT are expounded. Also, the characteristics of quantum communication are analyzed. Secondly, a channel encryption scheme based on quantum communication is proposed to ensure the communication security of IIoT. The scheme uses the five-particle entanglement state and two-particle bell state as entanglement channels to realize two-particle quantum teleportation. Finally, an Adaptive Key Residue algorithm is proposed based on the quantum key distribution mechanism. The algorithm verification suggests that the success rate of service distribution decreases with the increase in network load. When the service load reaches 1000, the Adaptive Key Residue algorithm can maintain a success rate of service distribution in the network higher than 0.6. Besides, the success rate of service distribution increases with the growth of the total key generation rate V and the key pool capacity C. The research results reported here are of great significance for realizing the secure communication of IIoT systems based on digital twins to ensure the effective operation of network communication and the secure transmission of data. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The great progress in the field of digitization and networking of the industry brings many advantages as well as new challenges. On the one hand, it enables new business models that hold great economic growth potential. On the other hand, it leads to an increased heterogeneity of the resulting value- added networks. This poses a striking problem when it comes to the interconnection of industrial devices and the establishment of new business models. Since the disadvantages can quickly outweigh the advantages, activities in this area proceed still very cautiously. A solution is offered by highly dynamic attribute-based usage control architectures at network-level, which monitor the entire communication in the value-added networks. Previous approaches, however, either have the disadvantage that they can only use communication metadata as attributes, or are highly specialized and tailored to the respective systems of the individual network nodes. In addition, they are usually pure access control systems instead of usage control systems. In this paper, the authors propose a novel attribute-based usage control model (ABUC) that allows simulation models in form of digital twins of the respective network components to be used in order to predict their behavior and thus control network traffic according to predicted usage. The ABUC model is then implemented in a use case and validated with several performance tests. © 2020 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Network
AB  - Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360° camera and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360° live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using a 360° web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost importance to many other services and domains such as national security. To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart mobility, using the Digital Twin Box. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Current power plants, including nuclear power plants are based on digital technology. According to the Industry 4.0 concepts, similarly to the intelligent manufacturing for new factories, the use of digital twins for power plants is expected to progress. Researchers do the safety and cybersecurity analysis from various perspectives utilize different approaches, e.g. on the safety side, the FMEA (Failure Mode & Effect Analysis), FMECA (Failure mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis) are recommended by FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) to do the reliability analysis. On the cybersecurity part, researchers do the analysis only with a focus on the communication protocol, the code/memory level or on the system functionality. We have addressed refueling machines as an example for the joint consideration of functional safety and cybersecurity in previous publications. Whereas in this paper, we propose to do a functionality and cybersecurity analysis based on the digital twin of an ICS (Industrial Control System). We take the refueling machine as an example and discuss how to twin the refueling machine with high detail firstly. In addition, the possible way of how to model the ICS is discussed, e.g. the Automation ML will be used to describe the system, the OPC UA will be applied to implement the communication. Then the feasibility and benefit of analyzing the system functionality and cybersecurity based on the digital twin model are discussed. © 2019 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI). All rights reserved.

T2  - Applied Sciences (Switzerland)
AB  - In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and interdependencies between different production assets are commonly ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System Manufacturing. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The digital twin has been used for decades in industries and in this last twenty years in the construction industry as a model that creates a connection between the physical systems and the digital systems. Thanks to IoT and AI, a static model evolves as a constantly updated system that is in connection with the real environment, thanks to data provided by sensors placed in it. In this paper the possibility of applying this system to complex infrastructures, such as port areas, is analysed. It has been chosen to apply it to a compact port area in order to be able to use this system, to investigate the different possibilities that it offers and to then be able to use it for larger port areas. The case study is located in the Ventotene Island, a small island located in the Tyrrhenian Sea, in front of the coast of central Italy, which is characterized by a considerable number of visitors during the summer season and a significantly reduced attendance during the rest of the year. It has been created an as-built digital model developed in BIM environment. It contains the architectural, structural and MEP models, both of port area and the building which is used for different services. Studies and simulations were carried out using the model, integrated with monitoring system to increase the security of the area. Finally, the model was connected to sensors installed in the real environment, obtaining the digital twin.

AB  - With the new industrial revolution of digital transformation, more intelligence and autonomous systems can be adopted in the manufacturing transportation processes. Safety and security of autonomous vehicles (AVs) have obvious advantages of reducing accidents and maintaining a cautious environment for drivers and pedestrians. Therefore, the transformation to data-driven vehicles is associated with the concept of digital twin, especially within the context of AV design. This also raises the need to adopt new safety designs to increase the resiliency and security of the whole AV system. To enable secure autonomous systems for smart manufacturing transportation in an end-to-end fashion, this article presents the main challenges and solutions considering safety and security functions. This article aims to identify a standard framework for vehicular digital twins that facilitate the data collection, data processing, and analytics phases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study for a vehicle follower model is analyzed when radar sensor measurements are manipulated in an attempt to cause a collision. Perceptive findings of this article can pave the way for future research aspects related to employing digital twins in the AV industry. © 2017 IEEE.

The collation of machinery information through connected smart sensors and connectivity ashore enables advanced data analytics providing insights into the causes and trends for platform or fleet performance. The opportunities are vast however, the challenges are also considerable. Increased sensor connectivity similar to the Internet of Things can lead to considerable cyber security concerns, and the amount of information available will need to be presented to the user in a suitable but succinct manner possibly using visualisation technology.

TI  - A specification-based state replication approach for digital twins
AU  - Eckhart, Matthias

T3  - Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security
AB  - Digital twins play a key role in realizing the vision of a smart factory. While this concept is often associated with maintenance, optimization, and simulation, digital twins can also be leveraged to enhance the security and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In particular, digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS, allowing to perform a security and safety analysis during operation without the risk of disrupting live systems. However, replicating states of physical devices within a CPS in functionally equivalent virtual replicas, so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of their counterparts, is an open research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli based on the system’s specification and then replicates them in a virtual environment. We believe that replicating states of CPSs is a prerequisite for a multitude of security and safety enhancing features that can be implemented on the basis of digital twins. To demonstrate the feasibility of the specification-based state replication approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it in an experimental CPS test bed. The results of this paper show that attacks against CPSs can be successfully detected by leveraging the proposed state replication approach. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Due to the installation of various apparatus in process industries, both factors of complex structures and severe operating conditions could result in higher accident frequencies and maintenance challenges. Given the importance of security in process systems, this paper presents a data-driven digital twin system for automatic process applications by integrating virtual modeling, process monitoring, diagnosis, and optimized control into a cooperative architecture. For unknown model parameters, the adaptive system identification is proposed to model closed-loop virtual systems and residual signals with fault-free case data. Performance indices are improved to make the design of robust monitoring and diagnosis system to identify the apparatus status. Soft-sensor, parameterization control, and model-matching reconfiguration are ameliorated and incorporated into the optimized control configuration to guarantee stable and safe control performance under apparatus faults. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed digital twin system are evaluated by using different simulations on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process in the presence of realistic fault scenarios. © 2019 ISA

The usage of control strategies and mathematical modeling techniques has shown promising results for optimizing hydraulic and water treatment processes. The Digital Twins (DT) as process integration technology are widely used in industry, and recently these technique usages in urban water systems are showing effective results in both management and planning. However, there is a lack of proper literature definition for DT applied to NbS, especially for stormwater and transboundary water security projects. Thus, this paper sought through a literature review to access the existing conceptual challenges and the DT definition as a framework, identify how the mathematical modeling reported in the literature can improve the DT development, and evaluate the potential benefits associated with the application of DT in NbS. © 2022 The Authors.

T2  - Buildings
AB  - Blockchain technology (BCT) can enable distributed collaboration, enhance data sharing, and automate back-end processes for digital twin (DT) decentralized applications (dApps) in the construction industry (CI) 4.0. The aim of this paper was to propose a software architecture and to develop a framework of smart contracts for blockchain-based digital twin (BCDT) dApps throughout the lifecycle of projects in CI 4.0. This paper leveraged the existing literature and action research interviews to identify and validate the critical industry problems, functional requirements (FRs), and non-functional requirements (NFRs) to be addressed by BCDT dApps in CI 4.0. Basic use cases were developed to design a framework of smart contracts for BCDT dApps throughout the lifecycle of projects. The analysis of an online survey was used to identify the key requirements and enablers to propose a software architecture for BCDT applications and to validate the requirements for developing the framework of a smart contract for BCDTs. The findings were: (1) The identification of key problems in CI 4.0 for each BIM/BCDT dimension (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, and contractual (cD)) and the related FRs and NFRs for BCDT applications. Additionally, key use cases were designed to address the problems identified. (2) The proposed BCDT architecture permitted us to narrow gaps in the literature on blockchain-based decentralized digital twins. Moreover, the proposed BCDT architecture and smart-contract framework addressed the main requirements in the literature on BCDTs. (3) The study leveraged the non-fungible token (NFT) standard to develop a framework for smart contracts that addressed the key use cases and the related industry problems and functional requirements that were identified. The study also considered the contractual dimension (cD) as an overarching dimension in relation to the other BCDT dimensions. (4) We also compared the costs of several public blockchains for executing the proposed smart-contract framework throughout the lifecycle of a medium-sized building project. The cost analysis permitted the development of criteria to evaluate the suitability of blockchain networks for BCDT applications in CI 4.0 depending on the principal blockchain networks’ properties (security, decentralization, scalability, and interoperability). Finally, this study resulted in a novel framework that included software architecture, smart-contract use cases, and selection criteria among blockchain networks for BCDT dApps in CI 4.0. © 2022 by the authors.

When a physical machine tool breaks down or malfunctions, engineers can always go back to check the digital traces of the “digital-twins” virtual machine for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper presents an integration of manufacturing data and sensory data into developing “digital-twins” virtual machine tools to improve their accountability and capabilities for cyber-physical manufacturing. The sensory data are used to extract the machining characteristics profiles of a digital-twins machine tool, with which the tool can better reflect the actual status of its physical counterpart in its various applications. In this paper, techniques are discussed for deploying sensors to capture machine-specific features, and analytical techniques of data and information fusion are presented for modeling and developing “digital-twins” virtual machine tools. Example of developing the digital-twins of a 3-axis vertical milling machine is presented to demonstrate the concept of modeling and building a digital-twins virtual machine tool for cyber-physical manufacturing. The presented technique can be used as a building block for cyber-physic manufacturing development. © 2017

AB  - Resource constraints in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) result in brute-force attacks, transforming them into a botnet to launch Distributed Denial of Service Attacks. The delayed detection of botnet formation presents challenges in controlling the spread of malicious scripts in other devices and increases the probability of a high-volume cyberattack. In this paper, we propose a secure Blockchain-enabled Digital Framework for the early detection of Bot formation in a Smart Factory environment. A Digital Twin (DT) is designed for a group of devices on the edge layer to collect device data and inspect packet headers using Deep Learning for connections with external unique IP addresses with open connections. Data are synchronized between the DT and a Packet Auditor (PA) for detecting corrupt device data transmission. Smart Contracts authenticate the DT and PA, ensuring malicious nodes do not participate in data synchronization. Botnet spread is prevented using DT certificate revocation. A comparative analysis of the proposed framework with existing studies demonstrates that the synchronization of data between the DT and PA ensures data integrity for the Botnet detection model training. Data privacy is maintained by inspecting only Packet headers, thereby not requiring the decryption of encrypted data. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Adoption of blockchain technology through digital twins in the construction industry 4.0: A PESTELS approach
AU  - Teisserenc, Benjamin
AU  - Sepasgozar, Samad
T2  - Buildings
AB  - The key challenges of the building, engineering, construction, operations, and mining (BECOM) industries are the lack of trust, inefficiencies, and the fragmentation of the information value chain into vulnerable data silos throughout the lifecycle of projects. This paper aims to develop a novel conceptual model for the implementation of blockchain technology (BCT) for digital twin(s) (DT) in the BECOM industry 4.0 to improve trust, cyber security, efficiencies, information management, information sharing, and sustainability. A PESTELS approach is used to review the literature and identify the key challenges affecting BCT adoption for the BECOM industry 4.0. A review of the technical literature on BCT combined with the findings from PESTELS analysis permitted researchers to identify the key technological factors affecting BCT adoption in the industry. This allowed offering a technological framework—namely, the decentralized digital twin cycle (DDTC)—that leverages BCT to address the key technological factors and to ultimately enhance trust, security, decentralization, efficiency, traceability, and transparency of information throughout projects’ lifecycles. The study also identifies the gaps in the integration of BCT with key technologies of industry 4.0, including the internet of things (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and DT. The framework offered addresses key technological factors and narrows key gaps around network governance, scalability, decentralization, interoperability, energy efficiency, computational requirements, and BCT integration with IoT, BIM, and DT throughout projects’ lifecycles. The model also considers the regulatory aspect and the environmental aspect, and the circular economy (CE). The theoretical framework provides key technological building blocks for industry practitioners to develop the DDTC concept further and implement it through experimental works. Finally, the paper provides an industry-specific analysis and technological approach facilitating BCT adoption through DT to address the key challenges and improve sustainability for the BECOM industry 4.0. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Digital twin plays an important role in safety monitoring of typical industrial workspaces such as substations. In the digital twin of a workspace, localizing and tracking the workers provide an intuitive way for updating their status. This paper proposes a visual human localization and safe monitoring method in a digital twin of workspace. In this paper, a 3D scanning model of the realistic workspace is utilized as its digital twin model, instead of a CAD model. The camera can be quickly calibrated with the digital twin by selecting a small number of paired 2D and 3D matching points. The pixel coordinate of human feet detected by the deep learning algorithm is mapped into the digital twin, and the human position is updated dynamically. A typical application of virtual electronic fence is developed based on the human localization results. The experimental results show that the calibration method is fast and effective, and the performance of human localization can meet the requirements of product management and safety monitoring. © 2022 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.

T2  - Computers and Security
AB  - This contribution presents a model for cyber-resilience of critical cyber infrastructures (CCI) based on the implementation of a digital twin. It addresses the risks associated with the integration of computational, communication and physical aspects of CCIs. We focus specifically on cybersecurity in the electric power sector due both to its salience and to the potential risks associated to failures in guaranteeing resilience. Informed by the literature on information security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational picture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs’ actors with increased cyber situational awareness, common understanding of incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole. We develop a process model and validate three design propositions through a formative evaluation in the context of a digital twin implementation in the EU electrical power sector. We discuss the implications of this model for further research as well as practical applications for the electrical power sector. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Creation, maintenance, and update of digital twins are costly and time-consuming mechanisms. The required effort can be optimized with the use of LiDAR technologies, which support the process of collecting data related to spatial information such as location, geometry, and position. Sharing such data in multi-stakeholder environments is hindered due to competition, confidentiality, and security requirements. Multi-stakeholder environments favor the use of decentralized creation and update mechanisms with reduced data exchange. Such mechanisms are facilitated by Federated Learning, where the learning process is performed at the data owner's location. Two case studies are presented in this paper, where LiDAR is used to extract information from industrial equipment as a part of the creation of a digital twin. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

AU  - Mashaly, Maggie
T3  - Procedia Computer Science
AB  - Digital twin technology can be considered as an innovation accelerator. By providing a live copy of physical systems, digital twins bring to the table numerous advantages such as accelerated business processes, enhanced productivity, and faster innovation with reduced costs. For these numerous advantages digital twin is an ideal solution for several problems in domains such as Industry 4.0, education, healthcare and smart cities. However, to make sure the digital twin contributes effectively to these domains by representing a synchronized real-time copy of the physical system, the network connecting the physical and digital twins should fulfill a set of requirements such as low latency of real-time communication, data security and quality. This paper provides an overview on the technology of digital twin and its application domains with a detailed discussion on its networking requirements and proposed enabling technologies to fulfill them. © 2021 The Authors.

T2  - Journal of Manufacturing Systems
AB  - With the rapid development of digital twin technology, a large amount of digital twin data named as big digital twin data (BDTD), is generated in the lifecycle of equipment, which is supposed to be used in digital twin enabled applications. However, in the implementation of these applications, data sharing problem which is caused by the lack of data security as well as trust among stakeholders of equipment, limits data using value. It is a novel way to introduce blockchain technology into digital twin to solve the problem. However, current methods cannot fulfill the requirements of exponential growth and timely sharing of BDTD. Therefore, a blockchain-based framework for secure sharing of BDTD is proposed to solve the problems. Cloud storage is integrated into the framework, with which, BDTD is encrypted and stored in Cloud, while the hash of BDTD and transaction records are stored in blockchain. Some rules of generating new block are designed to improve the processing speed of blockchain. An algorithm for optimal sampling rate selection is presented to maximize total social benefits of the participants of BDTD sharing. Simulation results show that the algorithm is better than traditional method for maximizing the total social benefits. Furthermore, a protype system is developed and evaluated based on Fabric test network. Evaluation results show that BDTD can be shared securely multiple times per second through the framework, which demonstrates the feasibility of the framework in supporting timely sharing of BDTD. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Reducing costs and increasing manufacturing output while creating reliable products are three essential components needed to keep a business competitive. In the past, having an asset that could address these three challenges at the same time would be challeging. However, recent advances in computer processing capabilities coupled with increases to network speeds allowed such a system to become possible; and this is known as a Digital Twin (DT), which represents a virtual copy of a production system or a product. This work exhibits a DT application of an Active Neutral Point Clamped (ANPC) inverter using a controller. The controller emulates the ANPC responses of a new Digital Signal Processing (DSP) firmware and validates this new firmware by using Design-For-Trust (DFTr) characteristics. If the new firmware is malicious, then it should be rejected, thus adding preemptive protection measures for inverter based distributed energy resources. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Human-Cyber-Physical-Systems (HPCS), such as critical infrastructures in modern society, are subject to several systemic threats due to their complex interconnections and interdependencies. Management of systemic threats requires a paradigm shift from static risk assessment to holistic resilience modeling and evaluation using intelligent, data-driven and run-time approaches. In fact, the complexity and criticality of HCPS requires timely decisions considering many parameters and implications, which in turn require the adoption of advanced monitoring frameworks and evaluation tools. In order to tackle such challenge, we introduce those new paradigms in a framework named RESILTRON, envisioning Digital Twins (DT) to support decision making and improve resilience in HCPS under systemic stress. In order to represent possibly complex and heterogeneous HCPS, together with their environment and stressors, we leverage on multi-simulation approaches, combining multiple formalisms, data-driven approaches and Artificial Intelligence (AI) modelling paradigms, through a structured, modular and compositional framework. DT are used to provide an adaptive abstract representation of the system in terms of multi-layered spatially-embedded dynamic networks, and to apply self-adaptation to time-warped What-If analyses, in order to find the best sequence of decisions to ensure resilience under uncertainty and continuous HPCS evolution. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) play an increasingly significant role in many critical applications. These valuable applications attract various sophisticated attacks. This paper considers a stealthy estimation attack, which aims to modify the state estimation of the CPSs. The intelligent attackers can learn defense strategies and use clandestine attack strategies to avoid detection. To address the issue, we design a Chi-square detector in a Digital Twin (DT), which is an online digital model of the physical system. We use a Signaling Game with Evidence (SGE) to find the optimal attack and defense strategies. Our analytical results show that the proposed defense strategies can mitigate the impact of the attack on the physical estimation and guarantee the stability of the CPSs. Finally, we use an illustrative application to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In the construction process of beam string structures, the environmental effect and corresponding mechanical properties of the structure are complex. The problem of the misjudgment of structural safety performance caused by the uncertainty of a structural mechanical parameter analysis under various factors needs to be solved. In this study, a method for capturing key components and an intelligent safety analysis of beam string structures based on digital twins (DTs) was proposed. Combined with the characteristics of DTs mapping feedback, a component capture and security analysis framework was formed. Driven by twin framework, multi-source data for structural safety analysis were obtained and the parameter association mechanism established. Considering the space-time evolution and the interaction between the virtual and real elements of the construction process, a multidimensional model was established. Driven by the Dempster–Shafer (D–S) evidence theory, the fusion of structural mechanics parameters was carried out. The safety of the structure was analyzed intelligently by capturing key structural components, thereby providing a basis for the safety maintenance of the structure. The integration of DTs modeling and multi-source data improves the accuracy and intelligence of structural construction safety analysis. In the analysis process, capturing the key components of the structure is the core step. Taking the construction process of a string supported beam roof (symmetrical structure) in a convention and exhibition center as an example, the outlined research method was applied. Based on DTs and D–S evidence theory, the variation degree of mechanical parameters of various components under temperature was determined. By comprehensively investigating the changes of various mechanical parameters, the key components of the structure were captured. Thus, the intelligent analysis of structural safety was realized. The comparison of data verified that the intelligent method can effectively analyze the safety performance of the structure. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - SUMMARY: Recent technological developments in the construction industry are seeking to create smart cities by using Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to enhance information models such as BIM. Currently, BIM models are commonly adopted to work with IoT-based systems and embrace smart technologies that offer interoperability in the communication layer. In future, it is envisioned that digital twins will provide new possibilities for cyber-physical systems via monitoring and simulation. However, rarely in this rapidly developing field is security fully considered. This paper reviews the relevant literature regarding the use of the IoT in the built environment and analyses current practices. It also presents examples of cities that use the IoT to improve construction and the lived experience. Finally, it reviews how digital twins factor in multiple layers defined in CPSs, from physical objects to information models. Based on this review, recommendations are provided documenting how BIM specifications can be expanded to become IoT compliant, enhancing standards to support cybersecurity, and ensuring digital twin and city standards can be fully integrated in future secure smart cities. © 2021 The author(s).

AB  - Industrial Digital Twins (DT) is the precise virtual representation of the manufacturing environment and mainly consists of the system-level simulation, which combines both manufacturing processes and parametric models of the product. As being one of the pillars of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, DT-s are widely integrated into the existing factories, enhancing the concept of the virtual factories. View from the research perspective is that experiments on the Internet of Things, data acquisition, cybersecurity, telemetry synchronization with physical factories, etc. are being executed in those virtual simulations. Moreover, new ways of interactions and interface to oversee, interact and learn are being developed via the assistance of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, which are already widely spread on the consumer market. However, already, VR is being used widely in existing commercial software packages and toolboxes to provide students, teachers, operators, engineers, production managers, and researchers with an immersive way of interacting with the factory while the manufacturing simulation is running. This gives a better understanding and more in-depth knowledge of the actual manufacturing processes, not being directly accessing those. However, the virtual presence mentioned above experience is limited to a single person. It does not enable additional functionalities for the simulations, which can be re-planning or even re-programming of the physical factory in an online connection by using VR or AR interfaces. The main aim of the related research paper is to enhance already existing fully synchronized with physical world DT-s with multi-user experience, enabling factory operators to work with and reprogram the real machinery from remote locations in a more intuitive way instead thinking about final aim than about the process itself. Moreover, being developed using real-time platform Unity3D, this multiplayer solution gives opportunities for training and educational purposes and is connecting people from remote locations of the world. Use-cases exploits industrial robots placed in the Industrial Virtual and Augmented Reality Laboratory environment of Tallinn University of Technology and a mobile robot solution developed based on a collaboration between the University of Southern Denmark and a Danish company. Experiments are being performed on the connection between Estonia and Denmark while performing reprogramming tasks of the physical heavy industrial robots. Furthermore, the mobile robot solution is demonstrated in a virtual warehouse environment. Developed methods and environments together with the collected data will enable us to widen the use-cases with non-manufacturing scenarios, i.e., smart city and smart healthcare domains, for the creation of a set of new interfaces and multiplayer experiences. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Enhancing cyber situational awareness for cyber-physical systems through digital twins
AU  - Eckhart, Matthias

T3  - IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA
AB  - Operators of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) need to maintain awareness of the cyber situation in order to be able to adequately address potential issues in a timely manner. For instance, detecting early symptoms of cyber attacks may speed up the incident response process and mitigate consequences of attacks (e.g., business interruption, safety hazards). However, attaining a full understanding of the cyber situation may be challenging, given the complexity of CPSs and the ever-changing threat landscape. In particular, CPSs typically need to be continuously operational, may be sensitive to active scanning, and often provide only limited in-depth analysis capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize the concept of digital twins for enhancing cyber situational awareness. Digital twins, i.e., virtual replicas of systems, can run in parallel to their physical counterparts and allow deep inspection of their behavior without the risk of disrupting operational technology services. This paper reports our work in progress to develop a cyber situational awareness framework based on digital twins that provides a profound, holistic, and current view on the cyber situation that CPSs are in. More specifically, we present a prototype that provides real-time visualization features (i.e., system topology, program variables of devices) and enables a thorough, repeatable investigation process on a logic and network level. A brief explanation of technological use cases and outlook on future development efforts completes this work. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) is a key enabling technology to realize cyber-physical system (CPS), which can truly perceive, map, and predict the operating state of physical entity. Through analyzing the generality of the testing process of large and complex equipment components (LCEC), a five-dimensional framework of DT-based test process management (DTTPM) is proposed, which comprises physical layer, network layer, data layer, model layer, and service layer. In order to realize the visualization and enhance the controllability, security, and information transparency of LCEC in the testing process, three key technologies are elaborated in detail as follows: (1) the construction of the twin semantic model of the testing process in model layer, (2) the synchronization method of twin model and physical entity based on real-time data, (3) and human–computer interaction–based visual monitoring of authenticity and safety coordination. Through the case of the vibration test for the crowned blade of a steam turbine by blade tip-timing measurement, the feasibility and flexibility of DTTPM are demonstrated. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

This reality has been promoting the Digital Twin (DT) concept and its importance on the industrial companies' business models. However, with these new opportunities, also new threads may rise, mainly related to industrial data protection and sovereignty. Therefore, this research paper will demonstrate the International Data Spaces (IDS) reference model's application to overcome these limitations. Following a pilot study with a Portuguese machine manufacturing company, this paper will demonstrate the development of a cutting and bending machines DT, leveraged on an IDS infrastructure for interoperability, for the plastic and metal industry and its importance to introduce this machine manufacturing company in a new B2B marketplace from the EU project Market 4.0. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Ever since cyber attacks focused on industrial and critical infrastructure settings, the awareness of the security issues of these systems has increased. These industrial control systems (ICS) mainly focus on operation and availability - instead of providing general security features. Moreover, the current Industry 4.0 movement aggravates this security gap by connecting the ICS to the enterprise network, which facilitates targeting these systems. Proper system testing can reveal the system's vulnerabilities and provide remedies. However, security measures are usually neglected or addressed after an emerging incident only, which results in high costs. To maximize the benefit of system testing, we argue that it should be carried out as early as possible, especially to render systems secure-by-design. In this work, we propose an approach for introducing security-by-design system testing by the application of a digital twin. A digital twin is able to represent a system virtually along its lifecycle. To enable security-by-design, the simulation capability of digital twin is harnessed to create a prospective environment of a planned system. This allows detecting vulnerabilities before they can emerge in the real-world and providing a adequate risk strategy. Our work shows how security-by-design system testing is anchored in the security applications along a system's lifecycle. Next to proposing a security-by-design system testing approach with digital twins, we implement a digital twin representing a pressure vessel, and demonstrate how to carry out each step of our proposed approach. During this proof-of-concept, we identify vulnerabilities and show how an attacker can compromise the system by manipulating values of the pressure vessel with the potential to cause over-pressure, which, in turn, can result in an explosion of the vessel. © 2022 Owner/Author.

TI  - Towards security-aware virtual environments for digital twins
T3  - CPSS 2018 - Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Cyber-Physical System Security, Co-located with ASIA CCS 2018
AB  - Digital twins open up new possibilities in terms of monitoring, simulating, optimizing and predicting the state of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Furthermore, we argue that a fully functional, virtual replica of a CPS can also play an important role in securing the system. In this work, we present a framework that allows users to create and execute digital twins, closely matching their physical counterparts. We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules. © 2018 ACM.

AB  - Virtual Reality-embedded Digital Twin (VR-DT) service integrates digital twin with virtual reality (VR) to visualize the digital representation of real-world production, boosting the digital transformation of manufacturing industry in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Balanced against the advantages of the VR-DT service, its data-driven, computing-intensive and security-sensitive features bring challenges to the current IIoT. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed resource allocation (BDRA) scheme to improve the average Quality of Service (QoS) of the VR-DT services with regard to service delay and transaction throughput. We formulate the joint optimization of channel assignment, subframe configuration, computing capacity allocation and block size adjustment as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. A Fully-Decentralized Multi-Agent Compound-Action Actor-Critic (FDMA-CA2C) algorithm is developed to solve the QoS optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can efficiently improve the average QoS of the VR-DT services in a realizable way as compared to existing schemes. IEEE

AB  - Digital twin (DT), machine learning, and industrial Internet of things (IIoT) provide great potential for the transformation of the container terminal from automation to intelligence. The production control in the loading and unloading process of automated container terminals (ACTs) involves complex situations, which puts forward high requirements for efficiency and safety. To realize the real-time optimization and security of the ACT, a framework integrating DT with the AdaBoost algorithm is proposed in this study. The framework is mainly composed of physical space, a data service platform, and virtual space, in which the twin space and service system constitute virtual space. In the proposed framework, a multidimensional and multiscale DT model in twin space is first built through a 3D MAX and U3D technology. Second, we introduce a random forest and XGBoost to compare with AdaBoost to select the best algorithm to train and optimize the DT mechanism model. Third, the experimental results show that the AdaBoost algorithm is better than others by comparing the performance indexes of model accuracy, root mean square error, interpretable variance, and fitting error. In addition, we implement empirical experiments by different scales to further evaluate the proposed framework. The experimental results show that the mode of the DT-based terminal operation has higher loading and unloading efficiency than that of the conventional terminal operation, increasing by 23.34% and 31.46% in small-scale and large-scale problems, respectively. Moreover, the visualization service provided by the DT system can monitor the status of automation equipment in real time to ensure the safety of operation. © 2021 Yu Li et al.

AB  - The complexity of cyberattacks in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) calls for a mechanism that can evaluate critical infrastructures’ operational behaviour and security without affecting the operation of live systems. In this regard, Digital Twins (DTs) provide actionable insights through monitoring, simulating, predicting, and optimizing the state of CPSs. Through the use cases, including system testing and training, detecting system misconfigurations, and security testing, DTs strengthen the security of CPSs throughout the product lifecycle. However, such benefits of DTs depend on an assumption about data integrity and security. Data trustworthiness becomes more critical while integrating multiple components among different DTs owned by various stakeholders to provide an aggregated view of the complex physical system. This article envisions a blockchain-based DT framework as Trusted Twins for Securing Cyber-Physical Systems (TTS-CPS). With the automotive industry as a CPS use case, we demonstrate the viability of the TTS-CPS framework through a proof of concept. To utilize reliable system specification data for building the process knowledge of DTs, we ensure the trustworthiness of data-generating sources through Integrity Checking Mechanisms (ICMs). Additionally, Safety and Security (S&S) rules evaluated during simulation are stored and retrieved from the blockchain, thereby establishing more understanding and confidence in the decisions made by the underlying systems. Finally, we perform formal verification of the TTS-CPS. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Digital twins, i.e., up-to-date digital copies of a physical object maintained in the cloud, make it possible to conveniently review a physical object’s state, indirectly interact with the physical object, or perform computations on the object’s state and history – also in combination with data from other digital twins. The concept of digital twins has seen wide uptake in Internet of Things use cases, e.g., in manufacturing to monitor a product’s lifecycle, or precision medicine to provide personalized treatment. Besides these benefits, challenges arise, especially if the involved data producers, clouds and data consumers are not in the same trusted domain: Who owns and controls the data? Are the parties (e.g., cloud) sufficiently trusted to handle privacy-sensitive data? In this work, we propose ARMOREDTWINS, i.e., a system for digital twins that protects the confidentiality of digital twin data while providing flexible and fine-grained sharing by employing key-policy conditional proxy re-encryption to enable processing on subsets of the data. Alternatively, to support computation on very sensitive data, our system integrates secure multi-party computation, which does not reveal the data items to the individual nodes performing the computation. Benchmarks of our implementation highlight the system’s feasibility and practical performance. Copyright © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved

T3  - Proceedings - 2019 15th European Dependable Computing Conference, EDCC 2019
AB  - Several methods exist for detecting process anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure. The assessment of such methods could be conducted using simulation or directly on a realistic operational testbed. While the results of an assessment on a testbed may be more authentic than those carried out using simulation, conducting such experiments is fraught with challenges such as the time required to set up and launch attacks thus limiting the variety and number of attacks launched. To overcome such limitations, while maintaining the reliability of the outcome of the assessment, an approach based on timed automata models of a critical infrastructure was investigated. The investigation involved development of a digital twin for a 6-stage water treatment plant. A design-centric anomaly detection method, as well as an attack launcher, were integrated with the model and experiments were performed. The outcome of this investigation reveals the value of the proposed approach in rapid assessment of a design-centric anomaly detection method. © 2019 IEEE.

T2  - Software and Systems Modeling
AB  - With the diffusion of integrated design environments and tools for visual threat modeling for critical infrastructures, the concept of Digital Twin (DT) is gaining momentum in the field of cybersecurity. Its main use is for enabling attack simulations and evaluation of countermeasures, without causing outage of the physical system. However, the use of a DT is considered foremost as a facilitator of system operation rather than an integral part of its architecture design. In this work, we introduce a specific architecture view in the system representation, called Cybersecurity View. From it, we derive a cybersecurity Digital Twin as part of the security-by-design practice for Industrial Automation and Control Systems used in Critical Infrastructures. Not only this digital twin serves the purpose of simulating cyber-attacks and devising countermeasures, but its design and function are also directly tied to the architecture model of the system for which the cybersecurity requirements are posed. Moreover, this holds regardless of whether the model is generated as part of the development cycle or through an empirical observation of the system as-is. With this, we enable the identification of adequate cybersecurity measures for the system, while improving the overall system design. To demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed methodology, its application is illustrated through two real-world use cases: the Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) and the Road tunnel scenario. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

T2  - Fatigue and Fracture of Engineering Materials and Structures
AB  - The comprehensive effect of multiple factors that include the geometric characteristics, load status, service characteristics, and failure mechanism will affect the safety of bridge crane structure. To evaluate the security of the bridge crane structure, the real-time prediction method of fatigue life of the bridge structure based on digital twin is proposed. The specific type of general bridge crane is selected as the physical entity of the research object, and the information acquisition system is utilized to get the current service status information about the physical entity. On this basis, combined with the historical service information and inherent information of physical entity, the fuzzy database is established. Meanwhile, twin data are formed by the clear quantification of fuzzy information and data processing technology. In accordance with structural characteristic and work cycle process of bridge crane, the analytical models of load, strength, defect, and fatigue life are established, respectively. The multi-theoretical calculation model is completed by encapsulating the analysis models and transmitting information, and then the main factors affecting the fatigue life of bridge crane structure are determined. With that, the comprehensive evaluation coefficient is calculated by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation theory. The response relationship between the information data and the fatigue life of bridge crane structure is described by the Kriging surrogate model constructed with experimental design. Real-time prediction of fatigue life of bridge crane structure is realized in a virtual space to depict the life cycle process. Taking QD20/10 t × 43 m × 12 m general bridge crane as an example, the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are verified, which provides a strong theoretical basis for dependable service and timely scrapping of cranes. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Safety management in hoisting is the key issue to determine the development of prefabricated building construction. However, the security management in the hoisting stage lacks a truly effective method of information physical fusion, and the safety risk analysis of hoisting does not consider the interaction of risk factors. In this paper, a hoisting safety risk management framework based on digital twin (DT) is presented. The digital twin hoisting safety risk coupling model is built. The proposed model integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modeling (BIM), and a security risk analysis method combining the Apriori algorithm and complex network. The real-time perception and virtual–real interaction of multi-source information in the hoisting process are realized, the association rules and coupling relationship among hoisting safety risk factors are mined, and the time-varying data information is visualized. Demonstration in the construction of a large-scale prefabricated building shows that with the proposed framework, it is possible to com-plete the information fusion between the hoisting site and the virtual model and realize the visual management. The correlative relationship among hoisting construction safety risk factors is ana-lyzed, and the key control factors are found. Moreover, the efficiency of information integration and sharing is improved, the gap of coupling analysis of security risk factors is filled, and effective security management and decision-making are achieved with the proposed approach. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art digital twin and digital thread technology in industrial operations. Both are transformational technologies that have the advantage of improving the efficiency of current design and manufacturing. Digital twin is an important element of the Industry 4.0 digitalization process; however, the huge amount of data that are generated and collected by a digital twin offer challenges in handling, processing and storage. The paper aims to report on the development of a new framework that combines the digital twin and digital thread for better data management in order to drive innovation, improve the production process and performance and ensure continuity and traceability of information. The digital twin/thread framework incorporates behavior simulation and physical control components, in which these two components rely on the connectivity between the twin and thread for information flow and exchange to drive innovation. The twin/thread framework encompasses specifications that include organizational architecture layout, security, user access, databases and hardware and software requirements. It is envisaged that the framework will be applicable to enhancing the optimization of operational processes and traceability of information in the physical world, especially in an Industry Shipyard 4.0. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The emergence of highly productive cyberphysical manufacturing systems has motivated researchers to focus on minimizing communication overheads and saving computing resources. Traditional methods for building virtual machines using web-service and sensor techniques require a lot of system resources and incur high overheads, which make these techniques unsuitable for cyberphysical cloud manufacturing (CPCM) systems. We propose a novel model, which builds digital twins (virtual machines) so that they can be adapted to the CPCM platform. To achieve this goal, we have designed a framework that can incorporate with MTconnect (a manufacturing protocol to retrieve process information from machine tools) to extract data from physical machines. In addition, we have also designed information models to represent the structure and reflect the real-time state of physical machines. © 1997-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Power systems worldwide are experiencing rapid evolvements with a massive increase of renewable generation in order to meet the ambitious decarbonization targets. A significant amount of renewable generation is from Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), upon which the system operators often have limited visibility. This can bring significant challenges as the increasing DERs’ can lead to network constraints being violated, presenting critical risks for network security. Enhancing the visibility of DERs can be achieved via the provision of communication links, but this can be costly, particularly for real time applications. Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that is considered as a promising solution for enhancing the visibility of a physical system, where only a limited set of data is required to be transmitted with the rest data of interest can be estimated via the DT. The development and demonstration of DTs requires realistic testing and validation enviorment in order to accelerate its adoption in the industry. This paper presents a real time simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing platform, specifically designed for prototyping, demonstrating and testing DTs of DERs. Within the proposed platform, a software-based communication emulator is developed, which allows the investigation of the impact of communication latency and jitter on the performance of DTs of the DERs. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the application of the developed DT prototyping process and testing platform to enable frequency control using the DTs, which provide valuable learnings and tools for enabling future DTs-based solutions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Digital twins are beginning to revolutionize many industries in the last decade, offering a plethora of benefits to optimize the performance of industrial systems. They aim to create a continuously synchronized model of the physical system that allows for rapid adaptation to dynamics, primarily to unpredicted and undesired changes. A vast range of industrial domains have already benefited from digital twin technology, such as aerospace, manufacturing, healthcare, city management and shipping. In addition, recent research is beginning to explore the integration of digital twins into computer networks to enable more innovation and intelligent management. One of the building blocks of digital twin technology is the Internet of Things, where wireless sensors and actuators are deployed to provide interaction between the physical and digital worlds. This type of network is complex to manage due to its strong constraints, especially when controlling critical industrial applications, which gave rise to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). We believe that optimizing IIoT will lead to effective integration of digital twins in Industry 4.0. In this paper, we design a Digital Twin Network (DTN) for IIoT where sensors, actuators, and communication infrastructure are replicated in the digital twin to enable real-time intelligent management of these networks. By taking advantage of Eclipse Hono which allows an efficient connectivity for the network devices and Eclipse Ditto for representing the devices states in a digital form and also providing easy access to these states for the DTN. In this way, cognitive network services such as predictive maintenance, sustainability features, network diagnostics, security management, resource allocation, energy optimization can be efficiently integrated and operated in the network lifecycle. We validate the proposed architecture by providing a resource allocation case study where we explain how the Time Slotted Channel Hopping mechanism is exploited in our architecture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - The proliferation of cyber-physical systems is driving the growing need to establish links between these systems and virtual environments. Particularly in the smart grid, the high costs of some devices and the imminent need to prevent manipulation of these devices in production environments make mechanisms that allow the manipulation of these physical objects in virtual environments necessary; this has been called a digital twin (DT). Conversley, cyberattacks are growing in all cyber-physical systems and cybersecurity is essential to the critical infrastructure of the smart grid. This work shows a small implementation of a DT system for smart metering systems in a smart home environment for testing cybersecurity issues. The results show that the use of DTs is feasible in various contexts of the smart grid, particularly in cybersecurity testing. © 1997-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The digital twin paradigm is a promising enabling technology to accelerate the decarbonisation of industrial sites that use process heat. With digital representations that look-like, behave-like, and connect to a physical system, digital twins bring together critical operational and asset data into a single knowledge store. However, a high-fidelity digital twin relying on the cloud in real-time with direct influence on operations exposes the plant to cyber attacks. We propose a software architecture for a Digital Twin that adaptively generates more accurate representations of its operations to detect malicious activities and mitigate their effects. To achieve this adaptivity, our solution leverages ML, time-series forecasting, concept drift detection and control stability analysis. To evaluate our solution, we develop a simulation of a simple industrial plant consisting of one PID-controlled steam-boiler and a variety of uncertainties. Our experimental evaluation suggests that Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control, a system identification technique, best contributes towards Self-Learning by producing verifiable models that better align the need for retraining with concept drifts. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - With the emergence of distributed energy resources (DERs), with their associated communication and control complexities, there is a need for an efficient platform that can digest all the incoming data and ensure the reliable operation of the power system. The digital twin (DT) is a new concept that can unleash tremendous opportunities and can be used at the different control and security levels of power systems. This paper provides a methodology for the modelling of the implementation of energy cyber-physical systems (ECPSs) that can be used for multiple applications. Two DT types are introduced to cover the high-bandwidth and the low-bandwidth applications that need centric oversight decision making. The concept of the digital twin is validated and tested using Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud host that can incorporate physical and data models as well as being able to receive live measurements from the different actual power and control entities. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the real-time implementation of the DT for the ECPS based on internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies. The normalized mean-square error for the low-bandwidth DT case was 3.7%. In the case of a high-bandwidth DT, the proposed method showed superior performance in reconstructing the voltage estimates, with 98.2% accuracy from only the controllers’ states. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the fierce competitive global market, enterprises need to face and overcome new challenges and requirements to stay ahead of competition. Cyber-physical systems, Internet of things, and digital twins are some of the contemporary technologies that are used in the context of Industry 4.0 in order to instill intelligence into the industrial sector by changing traditional manufacturing to smart manufacturing. The digitalized and interconnected nature of Industry 4.0 creates new security, privacy, and safety challenges that need to be addressed in order for it to be fully realized. This study presents an overview regarding the use of digital twins as a means to reinforce and secure cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0, in general. Digital twins connect the physical and virtual worlds and can be used in combination with other technologies to provide several merits in various sectors, such as real-time monitoring and controlling, prompt access to dynamic data, constant visualization and analysis, process optimization, advanced decision-making, and prediction systems. All in all, based on the literature review, digital twins can constitute an essential tool for the realization, reinforcement, and security of cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Reliable and secure grid operations become more and more challenging in context of increasing IT/OT convergence and decreasing dynamic margins in today's power systems. To ensure the correct operation of monitoring and control functions in control centres, an intelligent assessment of the different information sources is necessary to provide a robust data source in case of critical physical events as well as cyber-attacks. Within this paper, a holistic data stream assessment methodology is proposed using an expert knowledge based cyber-physical situational awareness for different steady and transient system states. This approach goes beyond existing techniques by combining high-resolution PMU data with SCADA information as well as Digital Twin and AI based anomaly detection functionalities. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In the last decade, Australian SMEs are steadily becoming more digitally engaged, but they still face issues and barriers to fully adopt Industry 4.0 (I4.0). Among the tools that I4.0 encompasses, digital twin (DT) and digital thread (DTH) technologies hold significant interest and value. Some of the challenges are the lack of expertise in developing the communication framework required for data collection, processing, and storing; concerns about data and cyber security; lack of knowledge of the digitization and visualisation of data; and value generation for businesses from the data. This article aims to demonstrate the feasibility of DT implementation for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by developing a framework based on simple and low-cost solutions and providing insight and guidance to overcome technological barriers. To do so, this paper first outlines the theoretical framework and its components, and subsequently discusses a simplified and generalised DT model of a real-world physical asset that demonstrates how these components function, how they are integrated and how they interact with each other. An experimental scenario is presented to transform data harvested from a resistance temperature detector sensor connected with a WAGO 750-8102 Programmable Logic Controller for data storage and analysis, predictive simulation and modelling. Our results demonstrate that sensor data could be readily integrated from Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and enabling DT technologies, where users could view real time data and key performance indicators (KPIs) in the form of a 3D model. Data from both the sensor and 3D model are viewable in a comprehensive history log through a database. Via this technological demonstration, we provide several recommendations on software, hardware, and expertise that SMEs may adopt to assist with their DT implementations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The rapid expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) necessitates the digitization of industrial processes in order to increase network efficiency. The integration of Digital Twin (DT) with IIoT digitizes physical objects into virtual representations to improve data analytics performance. Nevertheless, DT empowered IIoT generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in IIoT network. The framework first present a new DT model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of IIoT. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the DL scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In DL scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse AutoEncoder (LSTMSAE) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks. The practical implementation of our proposed framework proves considerable enhancement of communication security and data privacy in DT empowered IIoT network. IEEE

AB  - As the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining ground and becoming increasingly popular in smart city applications such as smart energy, smart buildings, smart factories, smart transportation, smart farming, and smart healthcare, the digital twin concept is evolving as complementary to its counter physical part. While an object is on the move, its operational and surrounding environmental parameters are collected by an edge computing device for local decision. A virtual replica of such object (digital twin) is based in the cloud computing platform and hosts the real-time physical object data, 2D and 3D models, historical data, and bill of materials (BOM) for further processing, analytics, and visualization. This paper proposes an end-to-end digital twin conceptual model that represents its complementary physical object from the ground to the cloud. The paper presents the proposed digital twin model’s multi-layers, namely, physical, communication, virtual space, data analytic and visualization, and application as well as the overlapping security layer. The hardware and software technologies that are used in building such a model will be explained in detail. A use case will be presented to show how the layers collect, exchange, and process the physical object data from the ground to the cloud. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Since the development of smart healthcare services, different solutions have been developed in the field of healthcare to increase the life expectancy of the patient by reducing the cost of healthcare. Digital Twin (DT) is considered one of the most promising technologies and a game changer in the field of healthcare. DT is generating a virtual imitation of a physical object that mimics the status of an event by changing the information in real time. In this article, a smart context-aware physical activity monitoring framework is developed by combining different advanced techniques such as IoT, DT, FoT, CoT, and Blockchain to maintain the sensitiveness of the healthcare domain. In the proposed study, the physical movements of an elder are analyzed by utilizing the sequential data processing capability of deep learning to detect irregular physical events. In addition, the proposed framework can keep the data of an individual secured by applying progressed security highlights of blockchain. The proposed solution effectively analyzed an irregular event of an individual with considerable accuracy in real time. The calculated outcomes have shown the effectiveness of DT with smart healthcare solutions that would help to develop effective medical services by bringing patients and medical care experts together. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed solution is measured with respect to irregular event recognition, model training and testing, rate of latency, and data processing cost. In this manner, a case study defines the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in the smart healthcare industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics
AB  - Mobile edge computing is one of the key enabling technologies of smart industry solutions, providing agile and ubiquitous services for mobile devices (MDs) through offloading latency-critical tasks to edge service providers. However, it is challenging to make optimal decisions of computation offloading and resource allocation while ensuring the privacy and information security of MDs. Consequently, we consider a new vision of Digital Twin (DT) empowered edge networks where the optimization problem is formulated as a two-stage incentive mechanism. Firstly, the resource allocation strategy is determined by the interaction among DTs according to the credit-based incentives. Afterwards, a distributed incentive mechanism based on the Stackelberg-based alternating direction method of multipliers is opted to obtain the optimal offloading and privacy investment strategies in parallel. Numerical results show that the proposed two-stage incentive mechanism achieves effective resource allocation and computation offloading while simultaneously improving the privacy and information security of MDs.

AB  - Oil and Gas Pipeline (OGP) projects face a wide scope of wellbeing and security Risk Factors (RFs) all around the world, especially in the oil and gas delivering nations having influencing climate and unsampled data. Lacking data about the reasons for pipeline risk predictor and unstructured data about the security of the OGP prevent endeavors of moderating such dangers. This paper, subsequently, means to foster a risk analyzing framework in view of a comprehensive methodology of recognizing, dissecting and positioning the related RFs, and assessing the conceivable pipeline characteristics. Hazard Mitigation Methods (HMMs), which are the initial steps of this approach. A new methodology has been created to direct disappointment investigation of pinhole erosion in pipelines utilizing the typical pipeline risk strategy and erosion climate reenactments during a full life pattern of the pipeline. Hence in the proposed work, manifold learning with rank based clustering algorithm is incorporated with the cloud server for improved data analysis. The probability risk rate is identified from the burst pressure by clustering the normal and leak category to improve the accuracy of the prediction system experimented on the lab-scale oil pipeline system. The numerical results like auto-correlation, periodogram, Laplace transformed P-P Plot are utilized to estimate the datasets restructured by the manifold learning approach. The obtained experimental results shows that the cloud server datasets are clustered with rank prioritization to make proactive decision in faster manner by distinguishing labelled and unlabeled pressure attributes. © IMechE 2022.

T2  - Buildings
AB  - The concept of digital twins is proposed as a new technology-led advancement to support the processes of the design, construction, and operation of built assets. Commonalities between the emerging definitions of digital twins describe them as digital or cyber environments that are bidirectionally-linked to their physical or real-life replica to enable simulation and data-centric decision making. Studies have started to investigate their role in the digitalization of asset delivery, including the management of built assets at different levels within the building and infrastructure sectors. However, questions persist regarding their actual applications and implementation chal-lenges, including their integration with other digital technologies (i.e., building information modeling, virtual and augmented reality, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing). Within the built environment context, this study seeks to analyze the definitions and characteristics of a digital twin, its interactions with other digital technologies used in built asset delivery and operation, and its applications and challenges. To achieve this aim, the research utilizes a thorough literature review and semi-structured interviews with ten industry experts. The literature review explores the merits and the relevance of digital twins relative to existing digital technologies and highlights potential applications and challenges for their implementation. The data from the semi-structured interviews are classified into five themes: definitions and enablers of digital twins, applications and benefits, implementation challenges, existing practical applications, and future development. The findings provide a point of departure for future research aimed at clarifying the relationship between digital twins and other digital technologies and their key implementation challenges. © 2022 by the authors.

For example, to what degree will they be integrated into cloud and industry 4.0 systems as well as how and if they should augment their physical counterpart. Those choices are accompanied by challenging security aspects, many of which have to be studied partially. In this paper, we present a novel digital-twin demonstrator that enables experimentation and advanced research on such systems. The demonstrator is cloud-native, has a distributed adaptive control system, incorporates edge and public clouds, a PLC, intrusion detection, a wireless network emulator, and an attacker. © 2021.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are helping to make smart cities a reality, thanks to technological advancements in the construction industry. Through use of Information Communication Technologies (ICT), CPS integrates information and the physical world. Integrating Building Information Models (BIM) with IoT and sensor using CPS is becoming a more common goal in the industry. The adoption of digital twins in the future will open up new opportunities for CPS using tracking, simulation, and optimization strategies. Researchers, on the other hand, often overlook the cybersecurity implications. Assimilation of BIM data and cybersecurity principles has been difficult so far, and as a result, cybersecurity has been neglected. Specifically, this research will address research question; What are the key cybersecurity needed practices of built environment stakeholders? To answer these questions, this paper will survey the research of adoption of the cyber-physical system and digital twins regarding the industry. and determine obstacles to the adoption of cybersecurity for digital twins/CPS in the built environment. The findings of this study validated the value of using digital twins in industry. As a result, this paper assesses the use of digital twins in CPSs in order to determine the practices for bolstering cybersecurity and integrating digital twin and city standards in future urban cities. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Emerging technologies such as blockchain and digital twins are essential for the rapid development and employment in Industry 5.0 revolution. With the growing number of industrial IoT nodes, optimizing the network and availing of limited resources to enable secure transmission is difficult. A digital twin is the virtual representation of a physical device that completely depends on sensor data for the critical decision-making simulation process. To this end, we combine a blockchain-based distributed network with a digital twin for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. This paper proposes a blockchain-based Proof of Authority (PoA) trust mechanism to provide high-quality services such as security and data privacy in IIoT. Furthermore, to enhance the authority of decentralized digital twin combined blockchain networks, we introduce a Deterministic Pseudo-Random Generation (DPRG) to generate a genesis block. To evaluate the trustworthiness of the proposed system, we simulate the blockchain network with a digital twin using IIoT sensor nodes. The simulation result shows that the PoA-based authority master nodes can reduce energy consumption and enhance data security. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Digital twins (DTs) is a promising technology in the revolution of the industry and essential for Industry 4.0. DTs play a vital role in improving distributed manufacturing, providing up-to-date operational data representation of physical assets, supporting decision-making, and avoiding the potential risks in distributed manufacturing systems. Furthermore, DTs need to collaborate within distributed manufacturing systems to predict the risks and reach consensus-based decision-making. However, DTs collaboration suffers from single failure due to attack and connection in a centralized manner, data interoperability, authentication, and scalability. To overcome the above challenges, we have discussed the major high-level requirements for the DTs collaboration. Then, we have proposed a conceptual framework to fulfill the DTs collaboration requirements by using the combination of blockchain, predictive analysis techniques, and DTs technologies. The proposed framework aims to empower more intelligence DTs based on blockchain technology. In particular, we propose a concrete ledger-based collaborative DTs framework that focuses on real-time operational data analytics and distributed consensus algorithms. Furthermore, we describe how the conceptual framework can be applied using smart transportation system use cases, i.e., smart logistics and railway predictive maintenance. Finally, we highlighted the future direction to guide interested researchers in this interesting area. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - As key technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, blockchain and digital twins have great potential to enhance collaboration, data sharing, efficiency, and sustainability in the construction industry. Blockchain can improve data integrity and enhance trust in the data value chain throughout the entire lifecycle of projects. This paper aims to develop a novel theoretical framework for the adoption of environmentally sustainable blockchain-based digital twins (BCDT) for Construction Industry (CI) 4.0. The paper identifies which key data from construction projects lifecycle should be anchored in BCDTs to benefit CI 4.0 and the environment. The paper also identifies key factors and non-functional requirements necessary for the adoption of BCDTs in a decentralized and sustainable CI 4.0. At first, a content analysis of the literature allowed the identification of which data from projects lifecycle would benefit from blockchain technology (BCT) adoption and what the key factors and non-functional requirements necessary for the adoption of BCDT in the CI4.0 are. Furthermore, the analysis of structured interviews and online survey permitted to firstly validate the hypotheses raised from the literature and to offer a novel framework for BCDT of CI 4.0 in the context of the circular economy (CE). The findings are that (1) the key project lifecycle data relevant for BCDTs relate to the BIM dimensions (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, and 8D) and a new dimension called the contractual dimension (cD) is also proposed. (2) Ecosystems of BCDTs should embrace a novel form of collaboration that is decentralized and presented as Level 4 maturity for BCDTs. This new level of maturity leverages distributed blockchain networks to enhance collaboration, processes automation with smart contracts, and data sharing within a decentralized data value chain. Finally (3), the main non-functional requirements for BCDTs are security, privacy, interoperability, data ownership, data integrity, and the decentralization and scalability of data storage. With the proposed framework including the BCDT dimensions, the Maturity Level 4, and the key non-functional requirements, this paper provides the building blocks for industry practitioners to adopt BCDTs. This is promising for CI 4.0 to embrace a paradigm shift towards decentralized ecosystems of united BCDTs where trust, collaboration, data sharing, information security, efficiency, and sustainability are improved throughout the lifecycle of projects and within a decentralized CE (DCE). © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - As real-time applications in information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) advance, new innovative concepts become possible. IT/OT convergence opens new pathways to design and operate intelligent cyber-physical systems, snch as the Digital Twin (DT) concept, which has been discovered as key technology by several industries. This paper describes how centralized and decentralized DTs can help to monitor and control future power systems with special consideration of their interaction in case of corrupted communication from cyber-attacks. While the virtual representation of substations is regarded from the edge computing perspective the control room of the interconnected power system represents the centralized perspective. The concepts allows to have a system wide perspective, while also keeping detailed information at hand. The future system operator in the control room will benefit from services provided by DTs analytical and control features, rising resilience to cyber-physical anomalies and enhance situational awareness. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

TI  - Digital twin technology for smart manufacturing and industry 4.0: A bibliometric analysis of the intellectual structure of the research discourse
AU  - Ante, Lennart
T2  - Manufacturing Letters
AB  - The Digital Twin (DT) concept is gaining increasing attention with the rapid growth of cyber-physical systems and smart manufacturing. DT comprises the digital reflection, replica or identity of physical systems, objects or assets, which, for example, can be used for industrial health monitoring or process optimization and tracking. This study provides an overview of the intellectual discourses of DT research. The 23,419 references of 647 publications on the topic of DT are empirically analyzed using bibliometric methods to identify underlying connections and research streams. Using explorative factor analysis, seven strands of research are objectively identified. These comprise i) DT as paradigm for the virtual representation of real systems, ii) DT for manufacturing processes and human-robot collaboration, iii) cyber-physical systems for coordination between physical and computational elements, iv) Industry 4.0 for the automation of manufacturing and industrial practice, v) relationship extraction and matching in a social manufacturing context, vi) advances in computing and communication technologies and vii) optimization of geometrical variation in spot welding sequences. An objective overview of the DT discourse, its underlying themes and high-impact publications is presented. © 2021 Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME)

AB  - The Exoskeleton represents a promising technology to equip manufacturing workplaces characterized by poor ergonomics, safety and security. Before this technology can be experimented and employed in operational manufacturing environments, the benefits should be highlighted in digital world at the holistic, process, workplace, line and production area levels, with focus on human work conditions. The development of the Digital Twins of Exoskeleton-centered workplaces faces the challenge of approaching the manual assembly and logistics processes as performed by hybrid resources: workers wearing Exoskeletons. From here, the coupling of an Exoskeleton to the digital worker and the realization of the Exoskeleton-Worker Digital Twin requires a thorough understanding of the human models and of wearable robotics, especially Exoskeleton design principles. A coupling methodology was developed and the prototype of the Digital Twins coupled with a commercial Exoskeleton was validated in automotive and logistics industries. The paper presents the performed research for: a) the optimization of the coupling process; b) the modification of the simulation parameters; and c) the embedding of the active Exoskeleton controller to a production and ergonomic simulation software. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The energy sector today is undergoing the digital revolution. The Internet of Things (IoT) and its subset, the Internet of Energy (IoE), that comprise, for example, smart meters, artificial intelligence (AI), or virtual reality (VR) with their practical application to the energy sector all together contribute to the enhancement of the smart energy grids of the future. Our paper focuses on the overview of the digital twins’ technology that are increasingly used in the smart grids. We discuss their application and usefulness for the improvement of the safety, security and reliability of the energy networks that include a two-way flow of information and power. Furthermore, we examine various types of digital twins and show use cases related to design, operation, control and safety of systems, testing, regulation, operator training and maintenance planning for energy utilities. Our research provides some innovative examples that might become the inspiration for the policy-makers and stakeholders working in the field of energy economics and policy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Industrial processes rely on sensory data for critical decision-making processes. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the trustworthiness of data. To this end, we envision a blockchain-based framework for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to address the issues of data management and security. Once the data collected from trustworthy sources are recorded in the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, we leverage digital twins (DTs) that can draw intelligent conclusions from the data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of DTs and blockchain to target key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and fault diagnosis. Finally, we identify outstanding challenges faced by the IIoT and future research directions while leveraging blockchain and DTs. © 1997-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Smart home systems are both technologically and economically advancing rapidly. As people become gradually inalienable to smart home infrastructures, their security conditions are getting more and more closely tied to everyone&#x2019;s privacy and safety. In this paper, we consider smart apps, either malicious ones with evil intentions or benign ones with logic errors, that can cause property loss or even physical sufferings to the user when being executed in a smart home environment and interacting with human activities and environmental changes. Unfortunately, current preventive measures rely on permissionbased access control, failing to provide ideal protections against such threats due to the nature of their rigid designs. In this paper, we propose CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based security framework that adopts a fundamentally new concept of protecting the smart home system by letting any sequence of app commands to be executed in a virtual smart home system, in which a deep-q network (DQN) is used to predict if the sequence could lead to a risky consequence. CommandFence is composed of an Interposition Layer to interpose app commands and an Emulation Layer to figure out whether they can cause any risky smart home state if correlating with possible human activities and environmental changes. We fully implemented our CommandFence implementation and tested against 553 official SmartApps on the Samsung SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 potentially dangerous ones, with 31 of them reported to be problematic the first time to our best knowledge. Moreover, We tested our CommandFence on the 10 malicious SmartApps created by [1] and successfully identified 7 of them as risky, with the missed ones actually only causing smartphone information leak (not harmful to the smart home system). We also tested CommandFence against the 17 benign SmartApps with logic errors developed by [2] and achieved a 100 CommandFence incurs a neglectable overhead of 0.1675 seconds. IEEE

AB  - With the recent advancements in industry 4.0 new concepts like “Digital Twin” has been rising also for the gastronomy sector. Gastronomic processes like cooking, serving, presenting, and preparing food have evolved with the new trends utilizing Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). This paper presents an innovative concept of digital cloning of gastronomic devices, named as eGastronomic things, to monitor their functions and simulate their operations. Here, eGastronomic things have both real physical appearances and their digital counterparts presenting them as a living 3D model augmented with its real incorporating data. Such live data can be any sensory or instant data observed while the device is working, or any catalogue data, like the model name and the owner information, stored in a database. In order to prove the concept, a case study where the digital twin of an industrial ice cream machine (as an example of an eGastronomic thing) is presented. The ice cream machine and its 3D digital twin can be visualized in a 3D virtual environment which enables interaction through AR or VR. The digital twin of the machine is secured with an electronic IoT gateway embedded in the machine and incorporated with a data acquisition board. Thus, the device is protected against unauthenticated use by realizing a secure access control mechanism. © 2019 IEEE

AB  - A digital twin is one of the most important technological concepts within Industry 4.0. The term is often used in current research and practice on industrial transformation. The article determines the place of a digital twin, highlights its most important characteristics, the technologies used, and evaluates the possibilities of application and effects for the industry. In the author’s opinion, it is important to assess the twin maturity, which allows separating this concept from the means of industrial automation. The complexity studying this object predetermines the need to use the methodology of collecting fragmented data, systematization of scientists’ opinions, and analysis of practical experience. The author identified definitions of the digital twin concept and formulated the necessary features of a digital twin, including a virtual multidisciplinary model of the object, automatic and bi-directional data exchange, and intelligent control capabilities. Maturity criteria were proposed for classifying digital twins; the key digital technologies were distributed on a maturity scale. In terms of the use of a digital twin in industry, the author proposed the structure of the main economic effects in improving the quality of business processes, creating a product, and implementing industrial innovation. An important area of further research is to analyze the economic security of the use of digital twins and data, as well as address the problem of information overload. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In networked industry, digital twins aggregate product data along the entire life cycle, from design and production to deployment. This enables interoperability between different data sources and analysis functions and creates an integrated data environment. Human digital twins have the potential to create a similarly interoperable and integrated data environment for more user-centric use cases in the field of the Internet of Things. In this case, personal data is processed and transmitted; therefore, the underlying infrastructure is then not product data management but identity management. In this paper, we discuss general aspects of the human digital twin, its role in open identity management systems, and illustrate its application in the field of home, building and office automation. We identify advantages and limitations and suggest future research opportunities. © 2020 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI). All rights reserved.

AB  - The (IoT) paradigm's fundamental goal is to massively connect the 'smart things' through standardized interfaces, providing a variety of smart services. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) include both physical and cyber components and can apply to various application domains (smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, etc.). The Digital Twin (DT) is a cyber clone of physical objects (things), which will be an essential component in CPS. This paper designs a systematic taxonomy to explore different attacks on DT-based CPS and how they affect the system from a four-layer architecture perspective. We present an attack space for DT-based CPS on four layers (i.e., object layer, communication layer, DT layer, and application layer), three attack objects (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability), and attack types combined with strength and knowledge. Furthermore, some selected case studies are conducted to examine attacks on representative DT-based CPS (smart grid, smart transportation, and smart manufacturing). Finally, we propose a defense mechanism called Secured DT Development Life Cycle (SDTDLC) and point out the importance of leveraging other enabling techniques (intrusion detection, blockchain, modeling, simulation, and emulation) to secure DT-based CPS. © 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Digital twin framework and its application for protection functions testing of relays

T3  - 3rd International Conference on Electronics and Sustainable Communication Systems, ICESC 2022 - Proceedings
AB  - A digital replica of a physical asset to replicate the product or a process which can use simulation and get updated from the real time data every second of the clock, and using this digital copy to perform product testing in order to save additional infrastructure costs, is what our concept of digital twin all about. This work focuses on creating a virtual mechanism to setup a typical relay module inside the Azure cloud environment in the form of a virtual machine. The application configuration is written and passed on to the soft IED in the cloud virtual machine with the help of a configuration and IED management tool. The protection functions are configured in such a manner that they can be tested in a cloud-based setup instead of performing the actual hardware testing which is a tiresome task in times like now. Furthermore, a device firmware update is passed on to the soft relay registered in IoT hub through a direct method which initiates a multistep process of downloading, applying and reporting back the status of the firmware update through device twin queries in realtime. This is one of the many use cases of digital twin framework. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Digital twins act through application programming interfaces to their physical counterparts to monitor, model, and control them. Beyond these traditional functions of digital twins, they must also act to secure their physical counterparts. A multi-model scheme is presented to help digital twins towards the task of securing the physical system. Additionally, this work includes an analysis of more than four hundred thousand tweets each relating to digital twin technology and cybersecurity which were collected during June and July in 2020. Of the first corpus of tweets collected by searching for #digitaltwin during the research period, only a small population of 10% reference security concepts. In the second and larger corpus of collected tweets, the top mentioned industries were health, education, and public. A naïve Bayes model reached a 70.3% accuracy at differentiating tweets that were either related to cybersecurity or the internet of things. The study also indicates that cybersecurity tweets are consistently more negative in many areas of sentiment when compared to tweets about the internet of things. The sentiment findings of cybersecurity tweets will reinforce the need to address culture in cybersecurity posture while the security multi-model schema contributes to the state of the art. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

AB  - Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology surrounded by many promises, and potentials to reshape the future of industries and society overall. A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted. The paper provides a deep insight into the technology, lists design goals and objectives, highlights design challenges and limitations across industries, discusses research and commercial developments, provides its applications and use cases, offers case studies in industry, infrastructure and healthcare, lists main service providers and stakeholders, and covers developments to date, as well as viable research dimensions for future developments in DTs. © 1998-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The evolution of next-generation mobile networks (5G, 6G...) is highly related to the latest virtualisation technology, which exposes it to new cyber-attack vectors. Therefore, there is an increasing need to train cybersecurity experts in the use of appropriate tools to prevent network attacks, especially those applied in mission-critical industrial environments. To meet this need, there are systems called cyber ranges that can be seen as an exemplification of a digital network twin. SPIDER is a cyber range specially oriented to train experts in next-generation network cybersecurity. In this paper we present how SPIDER is augmenting cyber range environments with ML tools, how it works and the way in which it can be used to train new experts. © 2021 IEEE.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB  - The concept of digital twin was originally proposed to assist product lifecycle management through the high-fidelity virtual product. In product lifecycle, there are many participators constructing a complicated network with enormous product lifecycle data. It is difficult to manage data of digital twin efficiently and securely from the perspectives of data storage, data access, data sharing, and data authenticity among the complicated network. Moreover, the virtual product is always updated to the latest state of the physical product by overwriting the history virtual product that records the development process of digital twin. To address abovementioned data management problems simultaneously, a data management method for digital twin of product based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. A peer-to-peer network is constructed to enhance data sharing efficiency among participators. The basic structure of blockchain is introduced, including block, chain, and transaction. The blockchain is used for data storage through cryptography that ensuring only eligible participators can access the corresponding data. The change sensitive characteristic of blockchain can ensure data authenticity as well. In addition, the concept of smart contract can be used to execute some actions automatically to increase data sharing efficiency. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data management method. The results show that the proposed method can solve the abovementioned data management problems simultaneously.

AB  - Digital Twin is a way to virtually represent or model a physical object using the real time data. This innovation sets up a way to deal with industries and organizations to supervise their products, consequently bridging the gap between design and implementations. As the name suggests, “Digital Twin” infers that a reproduction of the product is made in order to have a nearby relationship with the live item. The procedure of computerized twin begins by gathering real time data, processed data, and operational data and performs distinctive investigation which helps in anticipating the future. This additionally enhances the customer experiences by giving a digital feel of their product. The objective behind all these is the job of gathering information and putting them in a place, i.e., the cloud which could store exorbitant data. The user experience gets enhanced by the intervention of digital twin technology which could help in the successful working of the products geographically distributed. The impact of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing lifts up the digital twin. The information gathered from the sources can be arranged in terms of utilization and prospect to change on a timely basis. These data, as they are stored require proper coordination and a legitimate use. Digital Twin innovation assumes incredible opportunities in the field of manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, automobile and so on. The effect of having a digital twin for the product makes it simple for activities and recognize the blemishes, if any happened. This approach can help reduce the workload and furthermore can get trained on the virtual machine without the need of a specific training. With the most prevailing technologies of today, like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Internet of Things more prominent approach to train and monitor products, taking care of its own execution, collaborating to different frameworks, performing self-repairs are made possible. Hence the future is getting unfolded with the emerging DIGITAL TWIN era. The massive data utilized in the field of digital twin is prone to severe security breaches. Thus digital twin technology should be handled with extreme care so as to protect the data. Hence, this chapter identifies the ways and means of collecting, organizing and storing the data in a secured cloud environment. The data is filtered according to the use and priority and pushed into the cloud. It is determined to implement an exclusive algorithm for a secured cloud which would greatly benefit the users and the providers to handle and process it effectively.

AB  - The vehicular networks are vulnerable to cyber security attacks due to the vehicles' large attack surface. Anomaly detection is an effective means to deal with this kind of attack. Due to the vehicle's limited computation resources, the vehicular edge network (VEN) has been proposed provide additional computing power while meeting the demand of low latency. However, the time-space limitation of edge computing prevents the vehicle data from being fully utilized. To solve this problem, a digital twin vehicular edge networks (DITVEN) is proposed. The distributed trust evaluation is established based on the trust chain transitivity and aggregation for edge computing units and digital twins to ensure the credibility of digital twins. The local reachability density and outlier factor are introduced for the time awareness anomaly detection. The curl and divergence based elements are utilized to achieve the space awareness anomaly detection. The mutual trust evaluation and anomaly detection is implemented for performance analysis, which indicates that the proposed scheme is suitable for digital twin vehicular applications.

AB  - The purpose is to explore the application effects and limitations of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in 5G/B5G (Beyond 5G) mobile and wireless communication. Based on 5Gcommunication, the deep learning (DL) algorithm is introduced to construct the UAV Digital Twins (DTs) communication channel model based on DL. The Coordinated Multi-point Transmission (COMP) technology is adopted to study the interference suppression of UAVs. The key algorithm in the physical layer security is employed to ensure information communication security. Finally, the model constructed is simulated and analyzed. The transmission error rates and transmission estimation accuracy of several algorithms, including the proposed algorithm and ordinary Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), are compared under different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Results find that the convergence speed and convergence effect of the proposed algorithm has prominent advantages, presenting strong robustness; the proposed algorithm's estimation accuracy is about 150 times higher than the traditional algorithms. Further analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm's accuracy reaches 82.39%, which increases by at least 3.2% than other classic machine algorithms. The indicators of Precision, Recall, and F1 are compared as well. Apparently, the Precision, Recall, and F1 values of the proposed algorithm are the highest, while the transmission delay is the smallest. Therefore, the constructed UAV DTs wireless communication channel model has strong robustness and further reduces UAV limitations, providing a reference for improving UAV system performance in the later stage.

Although robots are already used in many different fields, the next generation of robots will need to work in shared workplaces with human operators complementing and not substituting their work. The implementation of such shared workplaces raises new problems, such as security of the human operator and defining simple and unambiguous communication interface between the human operator and the robot. To overcome these problems a detailed, up-to-date model, i.e., a digital twin, has been created.

AB  - Industrial control systems (ICSs), and particularly supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, are used in many critical infrastructures and are inherently insecure, making them desirable targets for attackers. ICS networks differ from typical enterprise networks in their characteristics and goals; therefore, security assessment methods that are common in enterprise networks (e.g., penetration testing) cannot be directly applied in ICSs. Thus, security experts recommend using an isolated environment that mimics the real one for assessing the security of ICSs. While the use of such environments solves the main challenge in ICS security analysis, it poses another one: the trade-off between budget and fidelity. In this paper we suggest a method for creating a digital twin that is network-specific, cost-efficient, highly reliable, and security test-oriented. The proposed method consists of two modules: a problem builder that takes facts about the system under test and converts them into a rules set that reflects the system's topology and digital twin implementation constraints; and a solver that takes these inputs and uses 0-1 non-linear programming to find an optimal solution (i.e., a digital twin specification), which satisfies all of the constraints. We demonstrate the application of our method on a simple use case of a simplified ICS network.

AB  - To ensure food security, agricultural production systems should innovate in the direction of increasing production while reducing utilized resources. Due to the higher level of automation with respect to traditional agricultural systems, Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) applications generally achieve better yields and quality crops at the expenses of higher energy consumption. In this context, Digital Twin (DT) may constitute a fundamental tool to reach the optimization of the productivity, intended as the ratio between production and resource consumption. For this reason, a DT Architecture for CEA systems is introduced within this work and applied to a case study for its validation. The proposed architecture is potentially able to optimize productivity since it utilizes simulation software that enables the optimization of: (i) Climate control strategies related to the control of the crop microclimate; (ii) treatments related to crop management. Due to the importance of food security in the worldwide landscape, the authors hope that this work may impulse the investigation of strategies for improving the productivity of CEA systems.

AB  - The digital twin of a system should contain not only the existing information but also an up-to-date picture of the current status. While this is easy with physical properties, which can be measured by sensors, it is more challenging to measure and to provide an up-to-date picture of properties like security and safety. We have investigated the modelling of such dependencies in use cases related to transparency as well as to self-adaptability. Based on our experience we propose further extensions of domains like reliability. This also has the potential to provide legal support to Industry 4.0 use cases when required.

AB  - The evolution of IoT technology is opening new avenues for value creation in many domains. The automotive industry is impacted on by several additional trends. One of those is autonomous driving (AD), which needs to be propped up by integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to improve user acceptance. Strong reliance of proposed solutions on communication and data management, as well as on a variety of complex and heterogeneous architectures and components exposes a range of vulnerabilities. The weaknesses are strongly correlated to dependability, which is crucial factor for success of AD. IoT4CPS, a flagship Austrian project, contributes to improvements in required dependability. It is developing guidelines, methods and tools for safe and secure integration of IoT into AD and corresponding smart production. The project addresses safety and security aspects of AD in a holistic manner. Some of the resulting considerations are described in this paper, alongside possible solutions based on virtualisation through usage of digital twins.

Traditional methods such as BIM are becoming less capable of real-time updates of building status and big data volume. By proposing innovations both in technique and management-a “continuous lifecycle integration” method based on the concept of Digital Twin (DT) and “early movement” of the general contractor, this paper reported a successful project case in a large hospital in China. The case realized continuous, scheduled integration of static data and dynamic data of more than 20 management systems from the design, construction, pre-O&M phase up to the O&M phase. Then, a DT software system with real-time visual management and artificial intelligent diagnosis modules was developed and deployed in a newly built DT control center. Managers have the ability to grasp the detailed status of the whole hospital by visual management and receive timely facility diagnosis and operation suggestions that are automatically sent back from the digital building to reality. The case has been steadily running for more than a year in the hospital and achieved desired performance by reducing energy consumption, avoiding facility faults, reducing the number of requested repairs, and enhancing the quality of daily maintenance work.

AB  - With the acceleration of the digital construction of the power grid, many important data is collected in data centers. If a fault is not found in time, it may cause serious information security incidents. In terms of the above problems, a digital twin modeling of data center computer room (DC computer room) based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network is proposed in this paper to monitor and early warn the failures of important equipment in computer rooms. The model adopts a five-layer architecture of the equipment layer, data interaction layer, model construction layer, simulation analysis layer, and application layer. Meanwhile, the evaluation characteristics of the equipment in the data center room are constructed, and the time sequence parameters of the equipment are predicted in real time based on the long-term and short-term memory network, and the equipment that may fail is warned in advance to assist the maintenance personnel in equipment maintenance.

AB  - Nowadays, with the widespread industrial use of digital data and relative maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics (artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data visualization), we can design, customize, and implement plenty of systems which once were unimaginable. A combination of the mentioned fields leads to the emergence of new technology, i.e., Digital Twins (DT). The potentials of DT in different fields have changed the perspective of most academia/industry leaders around the world. The fundamental concept of DT lies in developing the living and intelligent model which faithfully mimics the physical system during the lifetime of the physical ones. Indeed, by co-evolving with the physical system, the DT can precisely explore the design flaws of the virtual environment and make quick changes, which will ameliorate the design, prevent tedious confirmation and experiments. In review research, the principle definitions, architecture, characteristics of DT as well as the enabling key technologies of this context are briefly provided; after that, the ranges of applications of DT in manufacturing and industry will be presented. In particular, the evaluation details and challenges related to the zero-emission ships along with its DT model, which recently have been getting attention in academia, industry, and government, have been discussed. Eventually, the standardized application of blockchain technology, regarded as distributed ledger technology (DLT), will be introduced as a practical solution for data storage, data access, data sharing, data security, and data integrity in the DT.

AB  - A digital replica of any physical system or process is referred to as a digital twin (DT). In general, a DT is a software program that accepts real-world data of a physical system at ground level as inputs and creates useful outputs in the form of insights. At the moment, the manufacturing industry and business are concentrating their efforts on this technology. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the entire globe has turned to virtual meetings and live video interactions in various fields as health care, business, and education. We explore the most recent viewpoints and future technology trends that are most likely to drive DT in this study. The incorporation of blockchain in DT will allow the network to efficiently monitor and manage resource consumption and sharing. The idea of a digital twin of a smart city is presented in this article. Smart city development aims to enhance not just the city's overall performance, but also its basic infrastructure, procedures, and facilities, as well as its socioeconomic wellbeing. In order to strengthen security and privacy in smart cities, we examine how security may influence the DT. We offer a complete analysis of blockchain-based DT in this article. Overall, our study aims to give insightful direction for digital twin security and privacy research.

AB  - In the process of industrial Internet security situation analysis, affected by the perception model, the average approximation error of security assessment results is high. Therefore, an industrial Internet security evaluation technology based on digital twin is proposed. Design the industrial Internet assessment mode, design the industrial Internet technical framework according to the digital twin, and clarify the elements of security situation assessment. According to the sliding time window, the fuzzy knowledge base is established. The security situation awareness model is designed based on digital twin, combined with the calculation results of fuzzy closeness to improve the accuracy of automatic perception results. Establish a multi port access protocol and realize the industrial Internet security evaluation technology under the digital twin with the help of the backed up coded key file. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the evaluation results of the design method is always above 95%, the tamper-proof success rate is always above 95%, and the physical value difference between the final values is 0.10. Therefore, this method effectively improves the evaluation accuracy. and tamper-proof success rate, reducing the difference value, it effectively controls the deviation of Internet operation data, provides security, is feasible and effective.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB  - Air cargo loading in terminals demands precise planning to ensure efficient operations and minimise costs with limited time in the airport. Real-time visualisation and loading optimisation are becoming increasingly important due to dynamic loading considerations, including the segregation of dangerous goods and inherent lithium batteries, weight balancing, and oversize cargo handling. A closed-loop dynamic air cargo loading digital twin system, integrating a cargo load plan optimisation simulation, multi-dimensional immersive virtual reality system, Internet of Things, and real-time sensors, is proposed for connecting, monitoring and controlling the operations in physical operations and virtual space. A Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE)-based virtual reality system is used to visualise and experiment with loading procedures. The system uses a feedback loop during sensor data capture to facilitates the decision-making processes on the optimal cargo load plan. Scenarios are discussed demonstrating the impact of the digital twin system on the daily operations of an air cargo terminal, especially the allocation of dangerous goods and special cargo. Load planners can master complex air cargo load planning through the system with optimal solutions generated. The operations of cargo assembly and security screening with digital twins could be further developed for future development.

AB  - Security Operations Centers (SOCs) provide a holistic view of a company's security operations. While aiming to harness this potential, companies are lacking sufficiently skilled cybersecurity analysts. One approach to meet this demand is to create a cyber range to equip potential analysts with the skills required. The digital twin paradigm offers great benefit by providing a realistic virtual environment to create a cyber range. However, to the best of our knowledge, tapping this potential to train SOC analysts has not been attempted yet. To address this research gap, a concept of a digital twin-based cyber range for SOC analysts is proposed and implemented. As part of the virtual training environment, several attacks against an industrial system are simulated. Being provided with a SIEM system that displays the real-time log data, the trainees solve increasingly complex tasks in which they have to detect the attacks performed against the system. Thereby, they learn how to interact with a SIEM system and create rules that correlate events aiming to detect security incidents. To evaluate the implemented cyber range, a comprehensive user study demonstrates a significant increase of knowledge within SIEM-related topics among the participants. Additionally, it indicates that the cyber range was subjectively perceived as a positive learning experience by the participants.

AB  - Through the progress of Digital Twin technology and subsequent realization of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the threat of cyber attacks to those systems is rising. Due to differing requirements in Operational Technology (OT) systems, existing IT security is insufficient to secure CPS. To overcome these challenges, we are developing a highly modular Security Digital Twin (SDT), targeting a wide variety of OT/IoT use-cases and scenarios. Due to its modular design, a naive implementation of required data collection is highly cost-inefficient; to address this, a data collection abstraction layer for the SDT is proposed, utilizing upper layer data requirements through a unified interface. In a qualitative evaluation, the proposed solution is shown to be cost-effective.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) are defined as capable of achieving some elements of cognition, notably memory (encoding and retrieval), perception (creating useful data representations), and reasoning (outlier and event detection). This paper presents the development of a CDT, populated by construction information, facility management data, and data streamed from the Building Automation System (BAS). Advanced machine learning was enabled by access to both real-time and historical data coupled with scalable cloud-based computational resources. Streaming data to the cloud has been implemented in existing architectures; to address security concerns from exposing building equipment to undesirable access, a secure streaming architecture from BACnet equipment to our research cloud is presented. Real-time data is uploaded to a high-performance scalable time-series database, while the ontology is stored on a relational database. Both data sources are integrated with Building Information Models (BIM) to aggregate, explore, and visualize information on demand. This paper presents a case study of a Digital Twin (DT) of an academic building where various capabilities of CDTs are demonstrated through a series of proof-of-concept examples. Drawing from our experience enhancing this implementation with elements of cognition, we present a development framework and reference architecture to guide future whole-building CDT research.

AB  - Efficient collaboration among various stakeholders is important for the successful completion of a construction project. However, stakeholders in construction are fragmented, which in turn hinders accountable information sharing. To address this issue, the authors aim to develop and test an integrated digital twin and blockchain framework for traceable data communication. The digital twin updates building information modeling in near real-time using internet of things sensors, while the blockchain authenticates and adds confidence to all data transactions to the digital twin. The authors tested the framework with a case project where virtual positioning data from a prefabricated brick is transmitted to digital twin in near real-time, recorded on the blockchain with time stamps. The results show that the integrated digital twin and blockchain framework makes all data transactions traceable. This paper's primary contribution is the development of a framework that realizes accountable project-related information sharing across stakeholders.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the current technology acceptance model (TAM) in the field of mixed reality and digital twin (MRDT) and identify key factors affecting users' intentions to use MRDT. The factors are used as a set of key metrics for proposing a predictive model for virtual, augmented and mixed reality (MR) acceptance by users. This model is called the extended TAM for MRDT adoption in the architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry. Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist philosophical lens was adopted to conduct an inductive systematic and bibliographical analysis of secondary data contained within published journal articles that focused upon MRDT acceptance modelling. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach to meta-analysis were adopted to ensure all key investigations were included in the final database set. Quantity indicators such as path coefficients, factor ranking, Cronbach's alpha (a) and chi-square (b) test, coupled with content analysis, were used for examining the database constructed. The database included journal papers from 2010 to 2020. Findings The extant literature revealed that the most commonly used constructs of the MRDT-TAM included: subjective norm; social influence; perceived ease of use (PEOU); perceived security; perceived enjoyment; satisfaction; perceived usefulness (PU); attitude; and behavioural intention (BI). Using these identified constructs, the general extended TAM for MRDT in the AECO industry is developed. Other important factors such as “perceived immersion” could be added to the obtained model. Research limitations/implications The decision to utilise a new technology is difficult and high risk in the construction project context, due to the complexity of MRDT technologies and dynamic construction environment. The outcome of the decision may affect employee performance, project productivity and on-site safety. The extended acceptance model offers a set of factors that assist managers or practitioners in making effective decisions for utilising any type of MRDT technology. Practical implications Several constraints are apparent due to the limited investigation of MRDT evaluation matrices and empirical studies. For example, the research only covers technologies which have been reported in the literature, relating to virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), MR, DT and sensors, so newer technologies may not be included. Moreover, the review process could span a longer time period and thus embrace a fuller spectrum of technology development in these different areas. Originality/value The research provides a theoretical model for measuring and evaluating MRDT acceptance at the individual level in the AECO context and signposts future research related to MRDT adoption in the AECO industry, as well as providing managerial guidance for progressive AECO professionals who seek to expand their use of MRDT in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). A set of key factors affecting MRDT acceptance is identified which will help innovators to improve their technology to achieve a wider acceptance.

AB  - The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model's security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system's multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and 0.01 similar to 0.05 lambda value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.

AB  - 5G networks require dynamic network monitoring and advanced security solutions. This work performs the essential steps to implement a basic 5G digital twin (DT) in a warehouse scenario. This study provides a paradigm of end-to-end connection and encryption to internet of things (IoT) devices. Network function virtualization (NFV) technologies are crucial to connecting and encrypting IoT devices. Innovative logistical scenarios are undergoing constant changes in logistics, and higher deployment of IoT devices in logistic scenarios, such as warehouses, demands better communication capabilities. The simulation tools enable digital twin network implementation in planning. Altair Feko (WinProp) simulates the radio behavior of a typical warehouse framework. The radio behavior can be exported as a radio simulation dataset file. This dataset file represents the virtual network's payload. GNS3, an open-source network simulator, performs data payload transmission among clients to servers using custom NFV components. By transmitting data from client to server, we achieved end-to-end communication. Additionally, custom NFV components enable advanced encryption standard (AES) adoption. In summary, this work analyzes the round-trip time (RTT) and throughput of the payload data packages, in which two data packages, encrypted and non-encrypted, are observed.

AB  - Currently, the main problem highlighted by specialists during digital twins testing relates to ensuring the test results reliability. The aim of this article is to assess the uncertainty of testing digital product twins for compliance with electromagnetic compatibility standards. In this regard, the authors developed an automated system model for testing digital product twins for compliance with electromagnetic compatibility standards. This model is applicable to digital twins of any electronic products that are capable of creating electromagnetic interference. It can be also used in cases when the quality of operation depends on the effect of external electromagnetic interference. Real system simplifications and abstractions are used in modelling, and therefore it is necessary to ensure that the results of the simulation can be used in decision-making on the compliance of products with EMC requirements. The analysis of the fundamental works on assessing of testing product digital twins uncertainty allowed to estimate the most probable budget of uncertainties that can affect the result reliability of an automated system for testing digital product twins for compliance with electromagnetic compatibility standards. Uncertainty assessment was carried out using the methods proposed in the basic international EMC standards (CISPR 16-4-2: 2011, ISO / IEC 17025). The uncertainty estimation algorithm proposed by the authors can be applied by product manufacturers that strive to increase the test results reliability of digital twins for EMC. This is of particular importance to solve technical security problems in areas such as power industry, electronics, transport security systems and weapons.

AB  - To predict the transportation process of a class of metamorphic object, e.g., deformable interlink linear object (DLO), the system particularity and coupling complexity is much increased due to external metamorphic constraints compared with classic multi-robot manipulation system. To explore the coupling effect, a virtual DLO model described by wave PDE equations with velocity feedback is proposed for replacing external metamorphic constraints. Independent stability controller is designed for feedback control of virtual DLO from perspective of MSR considering model stabilization. With the integration of proposed virtual DLO model, a digital-twin prediction prototype system of metamorphic object transportation is established. To bridge the communication gap between physical and digital world, a THz communication-based system framework is proposed to implement the digital-twin prediction for extremely security-sensitive system. Both numeric simulation and industrial experiment prove the availability and feasibility.

AB  - The problem of performing cybersecurity tests over existing industrial control systems is well-known. Once it is deployed, a critical system cannot be made unavailable for the purpose of simulating a cyber attack and thus it is hard to introduce corrective measures based on actual test outcomes. On the other hand, a high security posture is required for critical infrastructure and security by design is mandatory for new projects. Such requirements call for an architectural approach to introduce security straight from the early development phases. However, the adoption of a systematic design approach does not guarantee the cost-effectiveness of security countermeasures analysis, which is an extremely cumbersome task as the creation of a physical model is often costly or impossible. To address these issues, we propose the introduction of a specific view in the system's architectural blueprint, called the Cybersecurity Digital Twin. It is an Enterprise Architecture model of the system specifically targeted at providing a sound base for simulations in order to devise proper countermeasures without any outage of the physical infrastructure. To provide a proof of concept and demonstrate the practical viability of the proposed solution, we apply the methodology to a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System use case, evaluating the system security of the obtained solution.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and Digital Twins (DTs) currently represent the two most notable examples of cyber-physical integration enabled by modern ICT technologies, and their adoption is becoming predominant to implement and analyse complex systems in several application domains. So-called cyber DTs are increasingly being used to carry out security analysis, monitoring and testing on the virtual replicas of complex systems rather than on the physical counterparts, especially when these may not be directly feasible due to cost and other constraints. However, since physical and virtual replicas live side by side in complex ecosystems, the need for secure and trustworthy DTs arises. In this paper, we introduce a preliminary conceptual framework aimed to increase the level of security of a complex CPS by leveraging a cyber DT providing advanced anomaly detection capabilities, achieved by means of state-of-art machine learning solutions (i.e., federated learning). The framework will also address the security and trustworthiness of the cyber DT itself, by leveraging both HW and SW solutions to support a secure communication and storage of the critical data exchanged among the physical and virtual worlds. To this aim, the integration of the blockchain technology into the DT architecture will be investigated.

AB  - The Digital Twin refers to a digital representation of any real-world counterpart allowing its management (from simple monitoring to autonomy). At the core of the concept lies the inclusion of the entire asset lifecycle. To enable all lifecycle parties to partake, the Digital Twin should provide a sharable data base. Thereby, integrity and confidentiality issues are pressing, turning security into a major requirement. However, given that the Digital Twin paradigm is still at an early stage, most works do not consider security yet. Distributed ledgers provide a novel technology for multi-party data sharing that emphasizes security features such as integrity. For this reason, we examine the applicability of distributed ledgers to secure Digital Twin data sharing. We contribute to current literature by identifying requirements for Digital Twin data sharing in order to overcome current infrastructural challenges. We furthermore propose a framework for secure Digital Twin data sharing based on Distributed Ledger Technology. A conclusive use case demonstrates requirements fulfillment and is followed by a critical discussion proposing avenues for future work.

AB  - The recent emergence of advanced computing technologies has opened a world of possibilities for bridging virtual-physical spaces in the future of urban air mobility (UAM). Digital twin technology (DT) introduces a coupled virtual-physical asset system that evolves over time in their digital and physical state-spaces associated with the real-time exchange of observed data and control inputs for high-fidelity operational services in UAM, such as traffic management, or vehicle maintenance. On the other hand, edge computing has been envisioned as a dominant computing paradigm in future UAM infrastructures to enable infinitesimal-latency processing of massive and heterogeneous data acquired from ubiquitous devices and vehicles. Furthermore, federated learning (FL) has recently been proposed to resolve the performance and security problems of traditional AI techniques featured by centralized data collection and training to offer a decentralized and cooperative data training pattern among a huge number of devices/vehicles (aka., agents) in multi agent DT systems for UAM. Lastly, the blockchain has emerged as a ledger technology in which data and processes are divided into tiny data blocks and concatenated into a series to reinforce the security and scalability of decentralized computing patterns. Realizing the advances and integration of the emerging technologies mentioned above is of paramount importance for the development of DT systems in UAM. Previous studies have not completely considered the integration and harmony of these existing technologies for the development of UAM DT systems. There has also been a significant lack in comprehension and integration of emerging technologies for the development of UAM-DT systems. In that context, this study proposes a comprehensive integrated UAM-DT platform and solution of FL with the blockchain in edge computing for the development of UAM-DT systems, called BlockFE-DT. First, we introduce the adoption of a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical foundation of coupled digital-physical twin systems for UAM, particularly for unmanned aircrafts. Afterwards, we review the fundamental concepts of FL, blockchain, and edge computing technologies to explore and propose an integration framework of FL with the blockchain in edge computing in the context of UAM-DT systems. Key issues in the integration are assimilated including explainable AI, dependability, and security. This work provides ground-breaking concepts and architectures for a blockchain empowered FL framework with edge computing in future UAM-DT systems.

AB  - The automated system replaces the driver, which makes autonomous vehicle to improve safety and convenience, so the market of autonomous vehicle is huge. However, the real-world application of autonomous vehicles faces many challenges due to the immaturity of automated systems. As a consequence, simulation verification plays an irreplaceable role in the application of autonomous vehicle (AV). Car-following is the most common driving scenario in mixed traffic flows, so it is essential to develop an appropriate and effective simulation method for AV. Combined with the existing AV simulation methods and digital twin (DT) technology, this paper proposes a DT-assisted method for AV simulation in a car-following scenario. The method makes the physical vehicle interact with the DT vehicle, and the DT vehicle can dynamically regulate the physical entities through real-time simulation data; the simulation verification can be displayed in the DT scenario to ensure the security of the simulation. Meanwhile, a DT-assisted simulation framework of AV is proposed, the framework includes physical entity components, DT components, and data processing and evaluation components. Besides, a DT-assisted simulation platform is developed base on Unity engine. Finally, the DT-assisted simulation of AV in the car-following scenario is implemented in field experiment. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be effectively conducted AV simulation in car-following, and the average of communication latency is 52.3 ms, which is smaller than the update frequency 15 Hz (66.6 ms) between DT-assisted platform and AV. The DT-assisted simulation method of AV proposed in this paper is applied in the car-following scenario, which effectively solves the challenges of car-following scenario simulation through virtual-real interaction.

AB  - This exploration is aimed at the system prediction and safety performance of the Digital Twins (DTs) of autonomous cars based on artiﬁcial intelligence technology, and the intelligent development of transportation in the smart city. On the one hand, considering the problem of safe driving of autonomous cars in intelligent transportation systems, it is essential to ensure the transmission safety of vehicle data and realize the load balancing scheduling of data transmission resources. On the other hand, convolution neural network (CNN) of the deep learning algorithm is adopted and improved, and then, the DTs technology is introduced. Finally, an autonomous cars DTs prediction model based on network load balancing and spatial-temporal graph convolution network is constructed. Moreover, through simulation, the performance of this model is analyzed from perspectives of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The experimental results demonstrate that in comparative analysis, the accuracy of road network prediction of the model reported here is 92.70%, which is at least 2.92% higher than that of the models proposed by other scholars. Through the analysis of the security performance of network data transmission, it is found that this model achieves a lower average delay time than other comparative models. Besides, the message delivery rate is basically stable at 80%, and the message leakage rate is basically stable at about 10%. Therefore, the prediction model for autonomous cars constructed here not only ensures low delay but also has excellent network security performance, so that information can interact more efﬁciently. The research outcome can provide an experimental basis for intelligent development and safety performance improvement in the transportation ﬁeld of smart cities.

AB  - Microgrids (MG) is originally designed to make Smart Grids more energy-efficient and reliable. The MG repre­ sents a complex cyber-physical system whose functioning is driven by the interaction of physical actions and computational elements, making it vulnerable to many forms of malicious cyber-attack. This study considers the effect of data integrity attack (DIA) on the performance of hybrid MGs, an important cyber threat to microgrids (MGs). Further, this paper develops a new process using sequential hypothesis testing (SHT) for detecting DIA on renewable energy resources and improving the security of information in hybrid MGs. By using a binary sample generated from the suggested approach, an analysis statistic is computed and afterward compared to 2 thresholds for deciding between the 3 options. On the measured energy production of renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, DIAs of various severity levels have been conducted for assessing the impact of DIAs on hybrid MG security. A standard IEEE test system has been used to evaluate the efficiency of the suggested process.

AB  - In modern networking industrial environments, characterized by the integration of Operation Technology and Information Technology, there is a strong need to ensure both safety and security of operations and communications. In this regard, IEC 62443 zones and conduits represent powerful high-level abstractions stressing the importance of clearly separating machines in relation to safety requirements and of clearly defining inter-machine communication security requirements. However, their actual implementation is still demanded to human-centric error-prone procedures performed by technicians directly on network elements, without any integrated plant-wide point of view. To overcome these issues, first of all we originally state the need of applying the Digital Twin approach to zones and conduits, making easier the definition and management of inter-machine security requirements. For instance, industrial technicians can specify that communication among two zones should always flows through a ciphered conduit with a given algorithm and key length, at the cost of increased latency. Secondly, we state the need of exploiting an intelligent reasoner to monitor the current state of the environment (represented by asset and network Digital Twins), actively reconfiguring them in case desired requirements are not satisfied. Then, the reasoner allows to enforce requirements while also considering the fulfillment of a proper tradeoff between security and performance, e.g., by reducing the ciphering complexity to ensure prompt packet dispatching whenever required. Performance results based on our working prototype demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution under stringent requirements typical of industrial environments. In particular, in terms of better flexibility we proved that our orchestrator is able to create a new Digital Twin in less than 2.5 s in a typical edge node with a medium load. In addition, proposed routing policies based on our machine learning reasoner led to the satisfaction of well-defined low latency requirements (250 ms) while avoiding packet dropping.

AB  - Background All recent technological findings can be collectively used to strengthen the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) sector. The novel technology of multi-access edge computing or mobile edge computing (MEC) and digital twins have advanced rapidly in the industry. MEC is the middle layer between mobile devices and the cloud, and it provides scalability, reliability, security, efficient control, and storage of resources. Digital twins form a communication model that enhances the entire system by improving latency, overhead, and energy consumption. Methods The main focus in this study is the biggest challenges that researchers in the field of IIoT have to overcome to obtain a more efficient communication environment in terms of technology integration, efficient energy and data delivery, storage spaces, security, and real-time control and analysis. Thus, a distributed system is established in a local network, in which several functions operate. In addition, an MEC-based framework is proposed to reduce traffic and latency by merging the processing of data generated by IIoT devices at the edge of the network. The critical parts of the proposed IIoT system are evaluated by using emulation software. Results The results show that data delivery and offloading are performed more efficiently, energy consumption and processing are improved, and security, complexity, control, and reliability are enhanced. Conclusions The proposed framework and application provide authentication and integrity to end users and IoT devices.

AB  - This study is aimed to explore the anti-epidemic effect of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as digital twins on the COVID-2019 (novel coronavirus disease 2019), so that the information security and prediction accuracy of epidemic prevention and control (P & C) in smart cities can be further improved. It addresses the problems in the current public affairs governance strategy for the outbreak of the COVID-2019 epidemic, and uses digital twins technology to map the epidemic P & C situation in the real space to the virtual space. Then, the blockchain technology and deep learning algorithms are introduced to construct a digital twins model of the COVID-2019 epidemic (the COVID-DT model) based on blockchain combined with BiLSTM (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory). In addition, performance of the constructed COVID-DT model is analyzed through simulation. Analysis of network data security transmission performance reveals that the constructed COVID-DT model shows a lower average delay, its data message delivery rate (DMDR) is basically stable at 80%, and the data message disclosure rate (DMDCR) is basically stable at about 10%. The analysis on network communication cost suggests that the cost of this study does not exceed 700 bytes, and the prediction error does not exceed 10%. Therefore, the COVID-DT model constructed shows high network security performance while ensuring low latency performance, enabling more efﬁcient and accurate interaction of information, which can provide experimental basis for information security and development trends of epidemic P & C in smart cities.

AB  - In order to solve the problem of personal information leakage caused by online shopping, the researchers propose a consumer personal information security and its perception based on digital twin and Internet of things. This paper takes the online shopping process as the main line, obtains the information security problems existing in each link through the analysis of each shopping link. Analyze the interactions and interactions between digital twins and the big data industry supporting them, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and online commerce. The results show that among all respondents, the perception of personal information security in the process of online shopping is “uncertain”, accounting for 40.78%. Secondly, the proportion of “agree” and “fully agree” information security is 38.47% and 9.54% respectively, while the proportion of “completely disagree” personal information security is only 1.47%, which shows that consumers are more confident in personal information security in online shopping, and also reflects consumers’ lack of perception of existing threats in online shopping. This shows that a considerable number of consumers believe that the online shopping cart and order information are safe, showing their trust in the online shopping website.

AB  - In order to effectively solve the current security problems encountered by smart wireless terminals in the digital twin biological network, to ensure the stable and efﬁcient operation of the wireless communication network. This research aims to reduce the interference attack in the communication network, an interference source location scheme based on Mobile Tracker in the communication process of the Internet of Things (IoT) is designed. Firstly, this paper improves Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) to meet the security and overhead requirements of digital twin networking communication. The access control policy is used to encrypt a random key, and the symmetric encryption scheme is used to hide the key. In addition, in the proposed interference source location technology, the inﬂuence of observation noise is reduced based on the principle of unscented Kalman ﬁlter, and the estimated interference source location is modiﬁed by the interference source motion model. In order to further evaluate the performance of the method proposed as the interference source, this paper simulates the jamming attack scenario. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of the proposed algorithm is 0.245 m, which is better than the ErrMin algorithm (0.313 m), and the number of observation nodes of the proposed algorithm is less than half of the ErrMin algorithm. To sum up, satisfactory results can be achieved by taking the Jamming Signal Strength (JSS) information as the observation value and estimating the location of the interference source and other state information based on the untracked Kalman ﬁlter algorithm. This research has signiﬁcant value for the secure communication of the digital twins in the IoT.
