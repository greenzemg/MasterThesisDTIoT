\section{Research Question}
In this paper, we are attempting to answer the following research questions: 
\begin{itemize}

    % RQ 1
    % \item RQ1. What mututal authentication schemes for DT and IoT application are discussed in the literature? 
    % \item How can we use Digital Twin to enhance security issue in IoT/IIoT application? 
    %  Replace schemes by  mechansims.
    \item \textbf{RQ1}: What are the security schemes presented in the literature to ensure the authentication between Digital Twin and its mapped physical devices? 
    This research question will be answered through systematic literature review with the following subcategory research questions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{ \textbf{RQ1.1}: What is the concrete concept of Digital Twin}
        \item{ \textbf{RQ1.2}: How Digital Twin is used to enhance the security of IoT applications}
    \end{itemize}

    % RQ 3
    % 
    \item \textbf{RQ2}: How to ensure the security requirement of digital communication between a Digital Twin and companion physical IoT device. 
    
    % Research Question 4
    % \item What are the performance and efficiency differences between the proposed scheme and the existing solutions presented in the literature?
    \item \textbf{RQ3}: What is the performance analysis comparison of using proposed scheme and the existing solution presented(discussed) in the literature? 
    % update the above question 
\end{itemize}
