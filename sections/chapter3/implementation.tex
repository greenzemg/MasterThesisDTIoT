\section{Implementation Approach}
To validate the applicability and efficacy of our proposed solution (based on lightweight cryptographic algorithms), we conducted an experiment using an ESP32 -- a resource-constrained IoT device -- and Ditto -- an open-source framework for building Digital Twin \footnote{https://eclipse.dev/ditto/}. We opt for ESP32 boards for the experiment due to the fact that they are low-cost and low-power devices in the market \cite{maier_comparative_2017}. Ditto was selected for its ease of customization through Java-based plugins and its widespread use in the open-source community.

This section provides a detail of the experimental setup (of Fig \ref{fig:experiment-setup}) and implementation detail of the lightweight encryption/authentication algorithm implemented on both the constrained device and the Digital Twin framework.
