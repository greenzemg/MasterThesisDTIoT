\end{figure}
 
Analysis of the distribution of selected papers based on publication year revealed that the majority of articles were published in 2022 and 2021 (see Figure \ref{fig:bar-chart-yaer}). Furthermore, the bar chart illustrates a general upward trend in the number of publications addressing security concerns for industries utilising Digital Twin and (I)IoT applications.  This trend indicates a growing interest and concern among researchers in the Digital Twin and (I)IoT security field and highlights the relevance of this systematic literature review.

Note that the data in the figure of search results obtained on May 14th, 2023 contain only 6 papers for the year 2023. Since this number covers less than half a year and considering the trend of published articles from the last 5 years, we expect a further increase in the number of papers by the end of 2023.

\subsubsection*{Keyword Frequency Analysis}
To gain a deeper understanding of the trending topics within the 67 selected papers published between 2018 and 2023, a frequency analysis of keywords was conducted. This analysis was performed by extracting keywords that appeared more than three times in the keyword sections of the articles using the VOSviewer \footnote{\url{https://www.vosviewer.com/} A tool for visualizing bibliometric network including the occurrence of keywords, coauthorship relationship.} tool. 

Further filtering and sensitization were applied to create a shortlist of keywords using a thesaurus text file (a text file used by VOSviewer with one column for keywords and another column for replacing words). Keywords which have similar meanings with different spellings and variations were merged. For instance, we replaced "artificial intelligence" and "deep learning" with "machine learning", and "intrusion detection" with anomaly detection. We also replaced the occurrence of "security" with "cybersecurity". We combined "control systems" under the term "industrial control system". "Smart grid" and "power grid" are considered similar concepts. Additionally, we have replaced the term "real-time" with "real-time system". We considered "emulation" and "simulation" as related concepts hence we used the "simulation" keyword as a representative for "emulation". 

The resulting frequency analysis of keywords, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:alluvial-key}, provides insight into the key themes and concepts that are prevalent in the research topic of Digital Twin and cybersecurity. In addition, this analysis can help guide future research by identifying areas where there is a need for further investigation and providing a sense of the current state of the field.

'digital twin' with 55 occurrences indicates the centrality of this concept in this review. 'cybersecurity' is the second most frequently mentioned word, indicating the selected papers focus on using Digital Twin to provide security services. 'iot' is the third a frequent mention word with 19 times mention.   This highlights the significant role of this enabling technology in sending and receiving data to and from the Digital Twin environment. 

This analysis identified several key enabling technologies, namely 'blockchain(9),' 'machine learning(8)' 'cloud computing(4)' and 'analytics(3)'. These technologies are the main driving force of Digital Twin to be used as a security tool. 

Our frequency analysis also revealed the prevalent adoption of Digital Twin within Industry 4.0, as evidenced by terms such as 'cyber-physical systems(8)', 'smart grid(7)', and 'industrial control systems(6)'. These industry sectors highlight the integration and utilization of Digital Twin in critical infrastructure, indicating its role in providing various services including security-related functions. 


The main security and non-security functions of Digital Twin identified from the analysis were 'anomaly detection(7)', 'network security(6)', and 'simulation(6)'. This indicates the growing interest in leveraging Digital Twin frameworks for proactive security measures (anomaly detection), monitoring and detecting security problems in interconnected networks and utilizing simulation techniques for testing security measures before they are deployed to real operation environments to avoid accidental failure. 

\subsubsection*{Keyword Co-relationship Network}
In order to gain further insights into the evolution of research in the field of Digital Twin and cybersecurity, a keyword co-relationship network analysis was extracted from the VOSviewer tool. 

This analysis aimed to identify clusters of related items and visualise the relationships between keywords over time. The results of this analysis revealed that in the early days of research on Digital Twin, keywords such as "computational modelling", "embedded system", "situational awareness", "safety", and "simulation" were frequently mentioned, which suggests that the primary focus of the research at that time was on utilising Digital Twin as a visual aiding tool. 

On the other hand, more recent research was characterized by the frequent mention of emerging technologies such as "blockchain," "machine learning," "e-learning" "5G," and "emulation" This indicates that the development of Digital Twin has shifted towards utilising these technologies and augmenting Digital Twin to provide more service other than used as a model.
