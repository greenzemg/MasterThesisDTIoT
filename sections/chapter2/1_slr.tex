% Based on the guidance obtained from previous studies on how to conduct a literature review, the authors decided to perform a systematic analysis of the existing literature. In this process, specific protocols and techniques are clearly described so that other researchers can replicate the study and get the same results. 

In this chapter, we presented a systematic literature review on Digital Twin (DT) in the context of Industry 4.0. We discussed the methodology employed for the literature review, including search criteria, data sources, and the selection process. The chapter also includes an analysis of the findings, identifying existing gaps in the research, and exploring existing security mechanisms discussed in the literature to secure the digital communication between Digital Twin and (I)IoT.

% For the literature part of this work, we opted to follow a systematic way of reviewing existing literature. In this chapter, we go through the systematic literature review process, from designing the review protocol to analyzing the result achieved. 

Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a formal and structured process of synthesizing existing research studies that are relevant to answer pre-defined research questions \cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007}. Its purpose is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the literature and identify research gaps \cite{carrera-rivera_how-conduct_2022}. Conducting an SLR allows researchers to gain knowledge and insights into a particular field or topic, and to build upon existing research by identifying areas that require further investigation.

In this paper, we adhered to the three-phase approach of conducting a systematic literature review as outlined by Kitchenham and Charter \cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007}, which includes planning the protocol, conducting the review, and reporting the results. This approach ensures that the systematic literature review is conducted in a structured and transparent manner, according to Kitchenham and Charter \cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007}. Using this guideline and additional resources, we present a flow diagram of our reviewing process as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:slr-proc}. 

The literature review of this study has two main objectives outlined below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item To identify and investigate how Digital Twin technology is used to enhance the security of Industry 4.0 use cases.

    \item To identify the security mechanisms employed in the literature to secure the data communication channel between the Digital Twin and the (I)IoT devices.
\end{itemize}

% To automate the systematic literature review process, from defining PICOC to data extraction, we use a web tool called\textit{parsif.al}\footnote{\href{https://parsif.al}{Parsifal} is an online tool designed to support researchers in performing systematic literature reviews in the context of software engineering. Geographically distributed researchers can work together within a shared workspace, designing the protocol and conducting the research}


\section{Review Protocol}
According to Kitchenham and Charter  \cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007}, it is important to define a review protocol that outlines the procedures and methods prior to commencing the review process. The protocol serves as a road map for conducting the review and ensures that the study can be replicated by providing a clear and detailed plan of the procedures to be followed \cite{carrera-rivera_how-conduct_2022}. Hence, in the subsequent section, we provide details of the review protocol that includes defining PICOC, research question, search query used, academic digital library selected, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and extraction form.

\section{Conducting Review}

In this study, we retrieved a total of 727 articles from online digital databases, namely ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Scopus, IEEExplore, ACM, and Web of Science, which are known for publishing computer science-related research studies.

We limit the search results for all databases based on inclusion/exclusion criteria defined in section \ref{sec:inc-exc}. As a reminder, we included only papers published between 2018 and 2023 in the field of computer science, and document-type articles from journals and conferences were considered for the final search result.

Note that search queries and strategies used for each selected database varied, as they offer different search mechanisms. The details are presented in the following sub-section.
