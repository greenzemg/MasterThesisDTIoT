\subsection{Search keys and Strategies}
Guided by the PICOC criteria and research questions, we construct four main search strings to create search queries for each selected database. These are, "Digital Twin" "IoT" "Authentication", and "Industry". Synonyms, alternative spellings, and similar semantic meanings are considered for each keyword and combined using \textit{"OR"}. 

During a pilot search on the majority of databases, we identified that adding synonyms of "Digital Twin" does not return new papers compared to searching using only the term "Digital Twin". Even though we included the synonym terms in the table below, we avoided using them during query construction to simplify our search string.
