\subsection{Study Selection and Refinement}

After the screening of 452 papers using the inclusion/exclusion criteria, we were left with 83 papers. However, during the review phase, we excluded 16 more papers and we ended with 67 papers for further review and analysis. 


We had to exclude several papers during our review process for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Irrelevant to (I)IoT and Industry 4.0}: Some papers were not relevant to securing applications related to \textbf{(I)IoT} with an \textbf{Industry 4.0} context. For instance, we came across a study that used a \textbf{Digital Twin} to secure a data center, which did not fit within our scope.

    \item \textbf{Duplicate Content}: We identified instances where the same study was submitted to different journals with different metadata, yet contained nearly identical content. Unfortunately, the tools we employed couldn't always catch these duplicates.
    
    \item \textbf{Non-Conference Source}: We excluded studies that were sourced from book chapters rather than conference proceedings, as they didn't align with our criteria.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of Relevance to Research Questions}: Some studies simply weren't relevant to any of the research questions we were addressing.
    
    \item \textbf{Unrelated to Industry Use Case}: Studies that focused on securing \textbf{(I)IoT} devices without any connection to an industry use case were also among the excluded papers.
    
\end{itemize}

As a result of this refinement and selection process, the final set of 67 papers were identified for in-depth data extraction and analysis. In the subsequent section, we present a review of these papers, with a focus on addressing two research questions:\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] How is Digital Twin used to enhance security in Industry 4.0?
    \item[-] And what security mechanisms are used to secure the communication channel between Digital Twin and (I)IoT? 
\end{itemize}
