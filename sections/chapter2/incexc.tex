\subsection{Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria }
\label{sec:inc-exc}

\textit{Inclusion}: We only considered studies written in English, accessible in full text, and published in journals or conferences in the field of computer science between 2018 and 2023. Note that we run our search queries  on March 14th, 2023. 

\textit{Exclusion:} Any studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria, including those written in a language other than English, not accessible in full text, papers classified as grey literature, published before 2018, or not related to computer science or our research questions, were excluded from the selection process. Our preliminary findings revealed that a significant number of papers--exceeding 20--that incorporate the term "Digital Twin" in their abstracts, keywords, or titles have been published since they year 2018. Another reason is the fact that Digital Twin is a new research topic and growing; most of the relevant papers have been published in the last 6 years.

Table \ref{tbl:table-inc-exc} provides the inclusion and exclusion criteria employed to filter research studies from the search results of databases.
