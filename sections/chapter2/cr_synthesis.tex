\section{Literature Review Result and Analysis}
In conducting this literature review, our primary objective is to answer two research questions related to the use of Digital Twin to enhance security in Industry 4.0. The first research question aimed to identify existing solutions that leverage Digital Twin to improve security in the use cases of Industry 4.0, while the second question aimed to identify the mechanisms used to secure communication between Digital Twin and (I)IoT devices.

In this paper, we followed the three-phase approach outlined by Kitchenham and Charter \cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007} to perform a systematic review of the literature. We leveraged automating tools, including Parsif.al for designing our review protocol, VOSviewer for conducting bibliometric analyses, and Logseq for data collection and to facilitate the review process.

We began by searching six different digital libraries and collecting a total of 727 papers. We then applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as a study refinement phase, to arrive at a final selection of 67 items that are relevant to answer the first two research question.

To ensure consistency in our review process, we developed a data extraction form as described in table \ref{tbl:extraction}. This approach allowed us to systematically analyze each of the selected papers and provide insights into the application of Digital Twin technology in Industry 4.0 use cases.
