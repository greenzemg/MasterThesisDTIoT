\subsection{Research Question of SLR}
Research questions and objectives must be established and clearly defined before going through the process of identifying studies and extracting data, as they serve as guiding principles for conducting a literature review\cite{carrera-rivera_how-conduct_2022}. Therefore, for the systematic literature review part of the research, we have established two research questions stated as follows:

\begin{itemize}

    % RQ1
    \item \textbf{RQ1:How is Digital Twin used to enhance the security in industry 4.0 use cases ?} - This research question aims to identify the potential benefit of Digital Twin in improving the security and safety of smart industries.
 
    \item \textbf{RQ2: What are the security methods presented in the literature to ensure the security of the data communicated between the Digital Twin and its mapped physical devices?} - This question focuses on the identification of authentication and encryption mechanisms used to ensure secure communication between Digital Twin and (I)IoT devices.
\end{itemize}
