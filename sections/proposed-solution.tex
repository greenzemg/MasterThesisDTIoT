\section{Proposed Solution}
% Version 1
% Implement efficient and lightweight cryptographic authentication schemes to enhance the security of communication channel between the Digital Twin and its counterpart physical components that cloud be any IoT device.In this project we envision a light weight cryptographic scheme that can able to provide data protection at transit as well as secure access to remote IoT devices deployed on remote industry area. 

% Version 2
The IoT devices are low power and resource constraints that are not capable of running traditional cryptographic schemes like AES and RSA. Nevertheless, these devices are being widely used in various sectors including manufacturing, transportation, health, power grid, and so on, for various application. In addition, IoT sensors have also become an integral part of Digital Twin technology to collect and send data over network. In this paper, we propose an efficient and lightweight cryptographic authentication schemes to enhance the security of the communication channel between the Digital Twin and its counterpart physical components which is in most cases resource constraint IoT devices. Besides, we envision our mutual lightweight authentication scheme can also provide secure access to remote IoT device(sensors) and  Digital Twin station.
