\section{Methods}
For this study, we adopted Kitchenham and Charter three phases of performing systematic literature review; namely, planning protocol, conducting review, and reporting review. Basing this guideline and other resources, we created flow diagram for conducting review (2nd phase). The flow chart of the scheme is depicted in the diagram in Figure \ref{fig:slr scheme}.
