\subsection{Search Queries and Search Strategy}
Different databases have their unique way of performing advanced searching, including varied search fields and filtering options. Having this in mind, to ensure a systematic way of performing searching, we followed the following protocol for searching. First, we look for papers containing the primary key term "Digital Twin" in their title. And then, we narrowed down the search results by incorporating security-related terms such as "authentication," "security," "encryption," and "cryptography" in the abstracts of the papers. Finally, we incorporated industry and IoT-related terms in the full text of the research papers to further narrow the search results.


% The three-stage search mechanism described above provided a clear and adaptable procedure for conducting searches in various databases. However, a potential drawback of this mechanism is that it relies on the availability of search capabilities in the "Title," "Abstract," and "Full Text" fields of the selected databases. If these capabilities are not provided by the selected databases, the consistency and the systematic nature of the mechanism will be limited.


\textbf{Web of Science}

To search for digital twin and internet of things terms in Web of Science, we used the "Topic" field, which includes the title, keywords, and abstract. For security-related terms such as authentication, encryption, cryptography, and industry-related terms, we searched in all fields. We excluded document types such as book chapters, early access, and editorials, and only selected articles and conference papers from the search results. The search query was executed for all available years under the computer science category, resulting in 136 articles.

\end{tcolorbox}


% In Web of Science, "Title" field is used to search for Digital Twin and internet of things terms. The security-related terms like authentication, encryption, cryptography, and encryption as well as terms related to industry are searched in all fields. From the search results of our query, document types such as book chapters, early access,and editorial are excluded. In other words, only document of type articles and conference papers are selected. We run the search query over all available years which are published under the category of computer science and 136 articles are returned as a result.

\textbf{Scopus}

The search mechanism in Scopus is similar to the Web of Science. The "Article Title" field is used to search for article that contain the terms "digital twin" in their title. This initial search yielded a total of 3330 references after applying the exclusion criteria. Then, the "Abstract" field is used to search  papers that have terms related to security, which includes  "authentication", "encryption", "cryptography", and "security". At this stage, we get 240 papers. In the final stage,  we further refined the search by incorporating keywords related to industry and the Internet of Things and searching within the "All Fields". Only articles and conference papers were selected, and documents such as book chapters, early access, and editorials were excluded. The search was conducted over all available years in the category of computer science, resulting in a total of 242 articles.

\textbf{IEEExplore}

Initially, we searched for "digital twin*" within the document title field. Then, we looked for security-related terms like authentication, cryptography, security, and encryption in the "Abstract" field. In the third stage, we expanded our search to include industry and IoT-related terms within the "Full text and Metadata" fields. This search led to the retrieval of 144 papers, which consisted of conference and journal articles.

\textbf{Filters}: Conferences Journals and Journals filters are applied.

\textbf{ACM}

Among of the six databases, ACM returned the lowest number of papers. Only 17 papers were retrieved using our search protocols. First, we search for papers with "digital?twin*" in the title. We further refined our search by searching for security related terms in the abstract and industry and IoT related terms in the "All" field.

\textbf{ScienceDirect(Elsevier)}

The advance search in ScienceDirect allow maximum of eight boolean operatorss. In addition, wildcard is not supported. Hence, we perform our search as follow. 
Title: "digital twin"

Title, abstrac, keywords: ("authenticatin" OR "cryptography" OR "security" OR "encrypt")

Find articles with these terms: ("internet of things" OR "industry" OR "factory" OR "manufacturing" OR "cyber physical system" OR "infrastructure" OR "smart device")

As a result of the above search result we retrieved 47 papers from ScienceDirect. 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!5!white, sharp corners=all, colframe=white!95!black]
\textbf{Query}

\textbf{Filter}: Refine by: Article Type(Review articles, Research articles), Subject areas(Engineering, computer science) 

\end{tcolorbox}


\textbf{SpringerLink}

One notable difference between SpringerLink and other databases is the absence of a separate field for searching queries in "abstract" and "full content." This limitation inhibits to use the similar strategy we used for the other databases. 
As a result of this limitation, we used alternative search mechanisms, briefly described in the  box below.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!5!white, sharp corners=all, colframe=white!95!black]
\textbf{Query}
General search: "digital twin*" AND ("authenticat*" OR "cryptography" OR "security" OR "encrypt*") AND ("internet of thing*" OR "industr*" OR "factor*" OR "manufactur*" OR "cyber physical system*" OR "infrastructure" OR "smart device*") 

\tcblower
\textbf{Filter}: Conference paper and articles are selected; English language; Computer science

Using small python snippets we filter papers that have "digital twin" in their title. Finally, we were able to find 188 papers from SpringerLink database.
