\subsection{Digital Library Sources}

In an attempt to perform an exhaustive search on literature that has relevant studies to our research question, we leverage six electronic archives (databases) that are known in publishing papers on computer science. These are ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Scopus, IEEExplore, ACM, and WebofScience.  Six of them were selected in accordance with quidelines provided by Kofod \cite{kofod-petersen_how_nodate} and Kitchenham \cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007}.
