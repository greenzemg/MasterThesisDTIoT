\subsection{Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria }
\label{sec:inc-exc}


\textit{Inclusion}: We only considered studies written in English, easily accessible in full text, and published in journals or conferences in the field of computer science between 2016 and 2022. 

\textit{Exclusion:} Any studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria, including those written in a language other than English, not accessible in full text, classified as gray literature, published before 2016, or not related to computer science or our research questions, were excluded from the selection process. The inclusion and exclusion criteria utilized for the purpose of filtering research studies from the search results of databases are presented in Table \ref{tbl:table-inc-exc}.
