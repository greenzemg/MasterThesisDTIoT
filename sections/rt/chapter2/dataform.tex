\subsection{Data Extraction Form}
Kitchenham et al.\cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007} state that a well-designed data extraction form is helpful to gather information from primary studies to address research questions. To achieve this in our study, we utilised the web-based tool, \textit{parsif.al}, to structure and design the data extraction form used to collect data from the selected articles. 

% Note that, the data extraction form is, and also was in our case, continuously evolving during the full-text review process.
