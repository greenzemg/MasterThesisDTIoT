According to Kitchenham et al.\cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007}, a well design data extraction form is crucial for collecting information from selected primary studies to address research questions. In this study we use parsif.al web tool to design and structure data extraction form for collecting data from selected papers.  

The data extraction form is continuously evolving during the full-text review process.
