A Master Thesis Project: Digital Twin and Securing IIoT applications. 

Abstract: 
Connectivity and data exchange are key features of Industry 4.0. In this paradigm,  (Industrial) Internet of Things ((I)IoT) devices are a vital component facilitating the collection and transmission of environmental data from the physical system to the central station for processing and analysis(Digital Twin). However, although (I)IoT devices play a critical role in this process, they are not inherently equipped to run strong encryption mechanisms to secure the data they transmit over wired or wireless channels. This research aims to explore the potential of Digital Twins (DT) in securing Industry 4.0 applications and the security mechanism employed to ensure confidentiality, integrity and authentication of data communicated between (I)IoT and DT through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). In this paper we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 73 papers where we extract data from 56 papers for further analysis and data extraction. The result SLR revealed that DT is growing and being widely adopted as a security tool particularly in Industry 4.0 using enabling technology like machine learning, data analytics, blockchain, and 5G network to provide security solutions such as intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, cyber range, and threat intelligence.
