\chapter{Literature Review}

In conducting this literature review, our primary objective is to answer two research questions related to the use of Digital Twin to enhance security in (I)IoT applications for industry 4.0. The first research question aimed to identify existing solutions that leverage Digital Twin to improve security in the context of (I)IoT applications, while the second question sought to identify the specific mechanisms used to secure communication between Digital Twin and IoT sensors.

In this paper, we followed the three-phase approach outlined by Kitchenham and Charter\cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007} to perform a systematic review of the literature. We leveraged automating tools, including Parsif.al for designing our review protocol, VosViewer for conducting bibliometric analyses, and Logseq for data collection, to facilitate the review process.

We began by searching six different digital libraries and collecting a total of 523 papers. We then applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as a quality assessment phase, to arrive at a final selection of 56 items that are relevant for this review.

To ensure consistency in our review process, we created a data extraction form as described in table \ref{tbl:extraction}, which also helps us make an analysis of each of the selected papers easily. By following a systematic approach, we were able to address our research questions and provide valuable insights into the use of Digital Twin in securing (I)IoT applications within industry 4.0 use cases.
