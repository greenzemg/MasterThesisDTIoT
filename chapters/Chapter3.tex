\chapter{Lightweight Cryptography Solution for (I)IoT-DT Communication}
\label{Chapter3} % For referencing the chapter elsewhere, use \ref{Chapter1} 



In the preceding chapter, the comprehensive examination of existing literature demonstrated that the majority of authors either presume the security of data transmitted from IoT sensors or recommend employing cryptographic methods like AES, SHA-256, and RSA to ensure a secure communication channel. However, applying such mechanisms on a resource-constrained device is unfeasible due to their substantial demands in terms of computation, memory, and power consumption \cite{vanderwalSecuringNetworksIoT2022a}

% In the previous chapter, the systematic literature review revealed that most of the authors either assume data communicated from IoT sensors are secure  or they suggest using AES, SHA-256, and RSA cryptography solutions to secure the communication channel. Implementing such mechanisms on a resource-constrained device however is impractical as these cryptographic solutions demand high resources in terms of computation, memory, and power . 



% The primary aim of this chapter is to respond to research question 3, which centers on enhancing the security of the communication channel between Digital Twin and resource-constrained (I)IoT devices. To tackle this issue, we present a proposed solution, which is a communication scheme involving the encryption of the data and authentication of the components using one of NIST's standardized lightweight algorithms known as ASCON.

The primary aim of this chapter is to respond to research question 3, which focuses on securing the communication channel between Digital Twin and resource-constrained (I)IoT devices. To address this challenge, we propose a solution (a communication scheme) that involves both encrypting and authenticating data communicated using one of NIST's standardized lightweight algorithms know as ASCON.  

Before diving into the implementation detail and the experiment outcome, we provide a background foundation for components and concepts relevant to the proposed solution in the following section.
