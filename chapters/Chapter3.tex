\chapter{Literature Review} 
\label{Chapter3} % For referencing the chapter elsewhere, use \ref{Chapter1} 
In conducting this literature review, our primary objective was to answer two research questions related to the use of Digital Twin to enhance security in IoT applications for industry 4.0. The first research question sought to identify existing solutions that leverage Digital Twin to improve security in the context of IoT applications, while the second question aimed to identify the specific mechanisms used to secure communication between Digital Twin and IoT sensors.

To conduct our literature review, we followed the well-established three-phase approach outlined by Kitchenham and Charter for performing a systematic review of the literature. We leveraged a variety of automated tools, including parsif.al for designing our review protocol, VosViewer for conducting bibliometric analyses, and logseq for data collection, to streamline the review process.

We began by searching seven different digital libraries and collecting a total of 523 papers related to our research questions. We then applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as a quality assessment phase, to arrive at a final selection of 57 relevant papers for review.

To ensure consistency and completeness in our review process, we developed a data extraction form in table\ref{tbl:extraction}, which we used to guide our analysis of each of the selected papers. By following a rigorous and systematic approach, we were able to address our research questions and provide valuable insights into the use of Digital Twin to enhance security in (I)IoT applications.

The integration of operational-technology and IT systems in Industry 4.0 increases the risk of cyber attacks, but Digital Twin technology offers opportunities to improve security according to Dietz et al\cite{dietzHarnessingDigitalTwin2022}. The literature review suggests indeed that Digital Twins can be applied to enhance security in IoT applications across multiple domains. The table\ref{tbl:lit-bench} in this field summarizes existing research, including the targeted sector, use case, enabling technology, contribution, and study type of each reference. The table demonstrates the wide range of sectors in which Digital Twins and cybersecurity can have a significant impact, including satellite, energy, power grid, intelligent transport systems, water, agriculture, automotive industry, and manufacturing. Enabling technologies used in the studies include big data,  AI(machine learning), cloud computing and data analytics, edge computing, blockchain, and NFV, among others. These technologies enable researchers to build DT-based systems that can improve the security of various sectors.

The contributions of the studies have been classified as frameworks, platforms, algorithms, and architectures. We classify a contribution as a platform if the research presents a complete set of DT-based security solutions. If the authors provide only a high-level overview of the proposed solution, we classify it as an architecture. On the other hand, if details are presented for each component of the architecture, we classify it as a framework.

Regarding the study types, the table shows that there are theoretical studies, case and experimental-based, and review-type studies. The theoretical studies tend to focus on proposing frameworks and architectures, while the case studies and experimental studies tend to evaluate the proposed frameworks and algorithms.
