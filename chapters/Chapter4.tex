The primary objective of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of using lightweight encryption/authentication with new proposed  schemes to improve communication security between constrained devices and Digital Twin. To validate the efficacy of our proposed solution, we conducted experiments using an ESP32 as the constrained device candidate and a widely-used open-source digital twin platform called Ditto. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the experimental setup (see Fig \ref{fig:experiment-setup}) used in this study and detailed implementation specifications for the lightweight encryption/authentication algorithm implemented on both the constrained device and the digital twin platform.
