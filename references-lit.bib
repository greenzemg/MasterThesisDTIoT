Therefore, there is an increasing need to train cybersecurity experts in the use of appropriate tools to prevent network attacks, especially those applied in mission-critical industrial environments. To meet this need, there are systems called cyber ranges that can be seen as an exemplification of a digital network twin. {SPIDER} is a cyber range specially oriented to train experts in next-generation network cybersecurity. In this paper we present how {SPIDER} is augmenting cyber range environments with {ML} tools, how it works and the way in which it can be used to train new experts. © 2021 {IEEE}.},

This paper considers a stealthy estimation attack, which aims to modify the state estimation of the {CPSs}. The intelligent attackers can learn defense strategies and use clandestine attack strategies to avoid detection. To address the issue, we design a Chi-square detector in a Digital Twin ({DT}), which is an online digital model of the physical system. We use a Signaling Game with Evidence ({SGE}) to find the optimal attack and defense strategies. Our analytical results show that the proposed defense strategies can mitigate the impact of the attack on the physical estimation and guarantee the stability of the {CPSs}.

As people become gradually inalienable to smart home infrastructures, their security conditions are getting more and more closely tied to everyone\&\#x2019;s privacy and safety. In this paper, we consider smart apps, either malicious ones with evil intentions or benign ones with logic errors, that can cause property loss or even physical sufferings to the user when being executed in a smart home environment and interacting with human activities and environmental changes. Unfortunately, current preventive measures rely on permissionbased access control, failing to provide ideal protections against such threats due to the nature of their rigid designs. In this paper, we propose {CommandFence}, a novel digital-twin-based security framework that adopts a fundamentally new concept of protecting the smart home system by letting any sequence of app commands to be executed in a virtual smart home system, in which a deep-q network ({DQN}) is used to predict if the sequence could lead to a risky consequence. {CommandFence} is composed of an Interposition Layer to interpose app commands and an Emulation Layer to figure out whether they can cause any risky smart home state if correlating with possible human activities and environmental changes. We fully implemented our {CommandFence} implementation and tested against 553 official {SmartApps} on the Samsung {SmartThings} platform and successfully identified 34 potentially dangerous ones, with 31 of them reported to be problematic the first time to our best knowledge. Moreover, We tested our {CommandFence} on the 10 malicious {SmartApps} created by [1] and successfully identified 7 of them as risky, with the missed ones actually only causing smartphone information leak (not harmful to the smart home system). We also tested {CommandFence} against the 17 benign {SmartApps} with logic errors developed by [2] and achieved a 100 {CommandFence} incurs a neglectable overhead of 0.1675 seconds. {IEEE}},

Its main use is for enabling attack simulations and evaluation of countermeasures, without causing outage of the physical system. However, the use of a {DT} is considered foremost as a facilitator of system operation rather than an integral part of its architecture design. In this work, we introduce a specific architecture view in the system representation, called Cybersecurity View. From it, we derive a cybersecurity Digital Twin as part of the security-by-design practice for Industrial Automation and Control Systems used in Critical Infrastructures. Not only this digital twin serves the purpose of simulating cyber-attacks and devising countermeasures, but its design and function are also directly tied to the architecture model of the system for which the cybersecurity requirements are posed. Moreover, this holds regardless of whether the model is generated as part of the development cycle or through an empirical observation of the system as-is. With this, we enable the identification of adequate cybersecurity measures for the system, while improving the overall system design. To demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed methodology, its application is illustrated through two real-world use cases: the Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-{ITS}) and the Road tunnel scenario. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag {GmbH} Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms, such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems. The development of digital twin technology in traditional industries such as manufacturing, construction, the automotive industry, agriculture and transportation has highlighted its potential, but often insufficiently explored the risks associated with their integration.

The related technologies of quantum communication are introduced to improve network communication. Firstly, the key {DTs} technologies in the construction of {IIoT} are expounded. Also, the characteristics of quantum communication are analyzed. Secondly, a channel encryption scheme based on quantum communication is proposed to ensure the communication security of {IIoT}. The scheme uses the five-particle entanglement state and two-particle bell state as entanglement channels to realize two-particle quantum teleportation. Finally, an Adaptive Key Residue algorithm is proposed based on the quantum key distribution mechanism. The algorithm verification suggests that the success rate of service distribution decreases with the increase in network load. When the service load reaches 1000, the Adaptive Key Residue algorithm can maintain a success rate of service distribution in the network higher than 0.6. Besides, the success rate of service distribution increases with the growth of the total key generation rate V and the key pool capacity C. The research results reported here are of great significance for realizing the secure communication of {IIoT} systems based on digital twins to ensure the effective operation of network communication and the secure transmission of data.  © 1986-2012 {IEEE}.},

Then, the incoming setpoints areautonomously examined using the digital twin, and only the safesetpoints are engaged to the inverter's local controller. This paperdemonstrates how the inverter's normal operating region and dynamicmodel are formed. In particular, the normal operation region isexperimentally verified by changing the P and Q setpoints engaged to thelocal controller, using a laboratory setup including a three-phase1.5-{kVA} {SiC}-{MOSFET} inverter and a 12-{kW} {NHR} 9410 regenerative power gridemulator. The results demonstrate that the self-security technique canpotentially protect inverters from man-in-the-middle attacks byexamining the incoming commands (new setpoints) using the inverter'sdigital twin before engaging the setpoints to the local controller.},

It utilizes smartmedical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet {ofThings} ({IoT}) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters,monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to supportjustin-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data isanalyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection ({AD}) in a centralizedhealthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in responsetime with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherentprivacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data toa centralized server, which may also introduce several security threatsto the {AD} model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcomethese issues with centralized {AD} models, here we propose a {FederatedLearning} ({FL}) based {AD} model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run {ADmodels} locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing {FLapproaches} perform aggregation on a single server which restricts thescope of {FL}, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical {FL} that allowsaggregation at different levels enabling multiparty collaboration. Weintroduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different {ADmodels} are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, wedevelop a new Federated Time Distributed ({FEDTIMEDIS}) Long Short-{TermMemory} ({LSTM}) approach to train the {AD} model. We present a {RemotePatient} Monitoring ({RPM}) use case to demonstrate our model, andillustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin ({DT}) andedge cloudlets.},

Nevertheless, {DT} empowered {IIoT} generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning ({DL}) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in {IIoT} network. The framework first present a new {DT} model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of {IIoT}. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the {DL} scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In {DL} scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse {AutoEncoder} ({LSTMSAE}) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention ({MHSA})-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit ({BiGRU}) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks.

Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physicalobjects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for securityanalysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployedin face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premisesdeployment can be expensive, implying a significant {CAPEX} whose returnwill depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable supportinfrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable datacollection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of theacquired resources.

Such Digital Twins arebuilt using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming {LogicControllers}, coupled with scalable and efficient data collectionprocesses, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learningmodels to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. Thevalidation approach of {ELEGANT}, which leveraged from the capabilities ofthe Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of usingcloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of theprojected {CAPEX} for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-{goOPEX}, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a {DTaaS}(Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm.

	abstract = {Several methods exist for detecting process anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure. The assessment of such methods could be conducted using simulation or directly on a realistic operational testbed. While the results of an assessment on a testbed may be more authentic than those carried out using simulation, conducting such experiments is fraught with challenges such as the time required to set up and launch attacks thus limiting the variety and number of attacks launched. To overcome such limitations, while maintaining the reliability of the outcome of the assessment, an approach based on timed automata models of a critical infrastructure was investigated. The investigation involved development of a digital twin for a 6-stage water treatment plant. A design-centric anomaly detection method, as well as an attack launcher, were integrated with the model and experiments were performed. The outcome of this investigation reveals the value of the proposed approach in rapid assessment of a design-centric anomaly detection method. © 2019 {IEEE}.},

Digital Twin technology, widely used in the aviation,manufacturing and automotive industries, has the potential to improvethe security and resiliency of the microgrid. In this paper, we presenta framework for adapting the Digital Twin to the application ofmicrogrid security. The Digital Twin is a real-time, physics-basedsimulation that runs alongside the physical system providing for itsconstant monitoring and control. The Automatic Network Guardian {forELectrical} systems, or {ANGEL}, will model both the cyber and physicallayers of the microgrid and provide real-time data visualization. As aresult, users will be aided in assessing the health of the physicalplant and overall behavior over a range of operating conditions. {TheANGEL} Digital Twin will be able to use the real-time two-way couplingbetween the simulation and physical system to update and evolve thesimulation to provide greater insight into the physical system.Ultimately {ANGEL} will provide the ability to diagnose and heal thephysical system, mitigating both component failures and the effects ofcyber attack. This paper will explain the methodology behind the designof this digital twin and the advantages of such an approach.

Once it is deployed, a critical systemcannot be made unavailable for the purpose of simulating a cyber attackand thus it is hard to introduce corrective measures based on actualtest outcomes. On the other hand, a high security posture is requiredfor critical infrastructure and security by design is mandatory for newprojects. Such requirements call for an architectural approach tointroduce security straight from the early development phases. However,the adoption of a systematic design approach does not guarantee thecost-effectiveness of security countermeasures analysis, which is anextremely cumbersome task as the creation of a physical model is oftencostly or impossible.To address these issues, we propose the introduction of a specific viewin the system's architectural blueprint, called the {CybersecurityDigital} Twin. It is an Enterprise Architecture model of the systemspecifically targeted at providing a sound base for simulations in orderto devise proper countermeasures without any outage of the physicalinfrastructure. To provide a proof of concept and demonstrate thepractical viability of the proposed solution, we apply the methodologyto a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System use case, evaluating thesystem security of the obtained solution.},

The delayed detection of botnet formation presents challenges in controlling the spread of malicious scripts in other devices and increases the probability of a high-volume cyberattack. In this paper, we propose a secure Blockchain-enabled Digital Framework for the early detection of Bot formation in a Smart Factory environment. A Digital Twin ({DT}) is designed for a group of devices on the edge layer to collect device data and inspect packet headers using Deep Learning for connections with external unique {IP} addresses with open connections. Data are synchronized between the {DT} and a Packet Auditor ({PA}) for detecting corrupt device data transmission. Smart Contracts authenticate the {DT} and {PA}, ensuring malicious nodes do not participate in data synchronization. Botnet spread is prevented using {DT} certificate revocation. A comparative analysis of the proposed framework with existing studies demonstrates that the synchronization of data between the {DT} and {PA} ensures data integrity for the Botnet detection model training. Data privacy is maintained by inspecting only Packet headers, thereby not requiring the decryption of encrypted data.},

Cyber-Physical Systems ({CPS}) include both physical and cyber components and can apply to various application domains (smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, etc.). The Digital Twin ({DT}) is a cyber clone of physical objects (things), which will be an essential component in {CPS}. This paper designs a systematic taxonomy to explore different attacks on {DT}-based {CPS} and how they affect the system from a four-layer architecture perspective. We present an attack space for {DT}-based {CPS} on four layers (i.e., object layer, communication layer, {DT} layer, and application layer), three attack objects (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability), and attack types combined with strength and knowledge. Furthermore, some selected case studies are conducted to examine attacks on representative {DT}-based {CPS} (smart grid, smart transportation, and smart manufacturing). Finally, we propose a defense mechanism called Secured {DT} Development Life Cycle ({SDTDLC}) and point out the importance of leveraging other enabling techniques (intrusion detection, blockchain, modeling, simulation, and emulation) to secure {DT}-based {CPS}.},

The novelty in our work is in proposing and analyzing the possibility to dynamically align the digital twin with its real counterpart. As a preliminary step toward the synthesis of a Digital Twin for the Smart Grid, we propose the adoption of an architectural view that gets dynamically aligned with the state of the world at deploy and operation time. In this manner, we lay out the basis for a maintenance-aware model, which is at the core of the “digital twin” concept. The availability of a digital twin allows the enforcement of policies for the devices when they connect to the Grid.

While the technology is available and deployment has a low barrier of entry in future applications, proper security frameworks are still at infancy stage and are being developed to fit varied implementations and device architectures. Further, the need for edge centric mechanisms are critical to offer security in real time smart connected applications with minimal or negligible overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of data security by using multiple device shadows (aka digital twins) for a single physical object. These twins are paramount to separate data among different virtual objects based on tags assigned on-the-fly, and are used to limit access to different data points by authorized users/applications only. The novelty of the proposed architecture resides in the attachment of dynamic tags to key-value pairs reported by physical devices in the system. We further examine the advantages of tagging data in a digital twin system, and the performance impacts of the proposed data separation scheme. The proposed solution is deployed at the edge, supporting low latency and real time security mechanisms with minimal overhead, and is light-weight as reflected by captured performance metrics.  © 2021 {IEEE}.},

They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the {SOC}, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the {SOC}. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the {SOC} by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management ({SIEM}) systems.},

	abstract = {In order to effectively solve the current security problems encountered by smart wireless terminals in the digital twin biological network, to ensure the stable and efﬁcient operation of the wireless communication network. This research aims to reduce the interference attack in the communication network, an interference source location scheme based on Mobile Tracker in the communication process of the Internet of Things ({IoT}) is designed. Firstly, this paper improves Attribute-Based Encryption ({ABE}) to meet the security and overhead requirements of digital twin networking communication. The access control policy is used to encrypt a random key, and the symmetric encryption scheme is used to hide the key. In addition, in the proposed interference source location technology, the inﬂuence of observation noise is reduced based on the principle of unscented Kalman ﬁlter, and the estimated interference source location is modiﬁed by the interference source motion model. In order to further evaluate the performance of the method proposed as the interference source, this paper simulates the jamming attack scenario. The Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}) value of the proposed algorithm is 0.245 m, which is better than the {ErrMin} algorithm (0.313 m), and the number of observation nodes of the proposed algorithm is less than half of the {ErrMin} algorithm. To sum up, satisfactory results can be achieved by taking the Jamming Signal Strength ({JSS}) information as the observation value and estimating the location of the interference source and other state information based on the untracked Kalman ﬁlter algorithm. This research has signiﬁcant value for the secure communication of the digital twins in the {IoT}.},

In this streamline, the digital twin ({DT}) is one of the most cutting-edge technologies of Industry 4.0, providing simulation capabilities to forecast, optimize and estimate states and configurations. In turn, these technological capabilities are encouraging industrial stakeholders to invest in the new paradigm, though an increased focus on the risks involved is really needed. More precisely, the deployment of a {DT} is based on the composition of technologies such as cyber-physical systems, the Industrial Internet of Things, edge computing, virtualization infrastructures, artificial intelligence and big data. However, the confluence of all these technologies and the implicit interaction with the physical counterpart of the {DT} in the real world generate multiple security threats that have not yet been sufficiently studied. In that context, this paper analyzes the current state of the {DT} paradigm and classifies the potential threats associated with it, taking into consideration its functionality layers and the operational requirements in order to achieve a more complete and useful classification. We also provide a preliminary set of security recommendations and approaches that can help to ensure the appropriate and trustworthy use of a {DT}.},

To ensure the security and effectiveness of data sharing in traffic control, this paper proposes a secure and privacy-preserving scheme for digital twin-based traffic control. Specifically, in the data uploading phase, we employ a group signature with a time-bound keys technique to realize data source authentication with efficient members revocation and privacy protection, which can ensure that data can be securely stored on cloud service providers after it synchronizes to its twin. In the data sharing stage, we employ the secure and efficient attribute-based access control technique to provide flexible and efficient data sharing, in which the parameters of a specific sub-policy can be stored during the first decryption and reused in subsequent data access containing the same sub-policy, thus reducing the computing complexity. Finally, we analyze the security and efficiency of the scheme theoretically.},

	abstract = {Operators of cyber-physical systems ({CPSs}) need to maintain awareness of the cyber situation in order to be able to adequately address potential issues in a timely manner. For instance, detecting early symptoms of cyber attacks may speed up the incident response process and mitigate consequences of attacks (e.g., business interruption, safety hazards). However, attaining a full understanding of the cyber situation may be challenging, given the complexity of {CPSs} and the ever-changing threat landscape. In particular, {CPSs} typically need to be continuously operational, may be sensitive to active scanning, and often provide only limited in-depth analysis capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize the concept of digital twins for enhancing cyber situational awareness. Digital twins, i.e., virtual replicas of systems, can run in parallel to their physical counterparts and allow deep inspection of their behavior without the risk of disrupting operational technology services. This paper reports our work in progress to develop a cyber situational awareness framework based on digital twins that provides a profound, holistic, and current view on the cyber situation that {CPSs} are in. More specifically, we present a prototype that provides real-time visualization features (i.e., system topology, program variables of devices) and enables a thorough, repeatable investigation process on a logic and network level.

	abstract = {Ever since cyber attacks focused on industrial and critical infrastructure settings, the awareness of the security issues of these systems has increased. These industrial control systems ({ICS}) mainly focus on operation and availability - instead of providing general security features. Moreover, the current Industry 4.0 movement aggravates this security gap by connecting the {ICS} to the enterprise network, which facilitates targeting these systems. Proper system testing can reveal the system's vulnerabilities and provide remedies. However, security measures are usually neglected or addressed after an emerging incident only, which results in high costs. To maximize the benefit of system testing, we argue that it should be carried out as early as possible, especially to render systems secure-by-design. In this work, we propose an approach for introducing security-by-design system testing by the application of a digital twin. A digital twin is able to represent a system virtually along its lifecycle. To enable security-by-design, the simulation capability of digital twin is harnessed to create a prospective environment of a planned system. This allows detecting vulnerabilities before they can emerge in the real-world and providing a adequate risk strategy. Our work shows how security-by-design system testing is anchored in the security applications along a system's lifecycle. Next to proposing a security-by-design system testing approach with digital twins, we implement a digital twin representing a pressure vessel, and demonstrate how to carry out each step of our proposed approach. During this proof-of-concept, we identify vulnerabilities and show how an attacker can compromise the system by manipulating values of the pressure vessel with the potential to cause over-pressure, which, in turn, can result in an explosion of the vessel. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

Targeting at the security issues of the drone system when it is attacked, this study adopts the improved long short-term memory ({LSTM}) network to analyze the cyber physical system ({CPS}) data for prediction from the perspective of predicting the control signal data of the system before the attack occurs. At the same time, the differential privacy frequent subgraph ({DPFS}) is introduced to keep data privacy confidential, and the digital twins technology is used to map the operating environment of the drone in the physical space, and an attack prediction model for drone digital twins {CPS} is constructed based on differential privacy-improved {LSTM}. Finally, the tennessee eastman ({TE}) process is undertaken as a simulation platform to simulate the constructed model so as to verify its performance. In addition, the proposed model is compared with the Bidirectional {LSTM} ({BiLSTM}) and Attention-{BiLSTM} models proposed by other scholars. It was found that the root mean square error ({RMSE}) of the proposed model is the smallest (0.20) when the number of hidden layer nodes is 26. Comparison with the actual flow value shows that the proposed algorithm is more accurate with better fitting. Therefore, the constructed drone attack prediction model can achieve higher prediction accuracy and obvious better robustness under the premise of ensuring errors, which can provide experimental basis for the later security and intelligent development of drone system.},
